 *  - The total number of threads (n) that must arrive at the barrier.
 *  - A counter (k) to keep track of how many threads have arrived.
 *  - A boolean (outgoing) to indicate whether threads are being released
 *    from the barrier or are still arriving.

 * barrier state changes appropriately.
 *
