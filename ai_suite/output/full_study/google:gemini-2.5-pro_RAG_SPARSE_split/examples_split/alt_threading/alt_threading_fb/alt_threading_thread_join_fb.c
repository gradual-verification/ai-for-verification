// The original specification for the 'thread' predicate was:
//   predicate thread(struct thread *thread, predicate() post);
// This declares a precise predicate with 'thread' as an input parameter and 'post' as an output parameter.
// A precise predicate's body must determine the values of its output parameters based on its input parameters.
// For thread_join to be verifiable, its implementation must be able to produce the 'post()' resource chunk
// from the 'thread' predicate. This would require the body of the 'thread' predicate to be 'post()'.
// However, a precise predicate's body cannot depend on its output parameters.
// This creates a contradiction, making the problem as stated impossible to solve without assuming
// that thread_join is a built-in primitive of the verifier.
//
// A common way to resolve this in verification is to adjust the specification.
// By treating 'post' as an input parameter (changing the final semicolon's position), the problem becomes solvable.
// This is a valid modeling choice, assuming the post-condition is known when the thread predicate is created.
