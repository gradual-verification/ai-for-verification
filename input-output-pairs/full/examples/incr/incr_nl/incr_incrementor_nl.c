/***
 * Struct: counter

Description:
Represents a shared counter protected by a mutex to ensure thread-safe access.

Fields:
- mutex: A pointer to a mutex that guards access to the counter.
- count: An integer value representing the counter.

// TODO: make this function pass the verification
/***
 * Function: incrementor

Description:
A thread function that loops infinitely, incrementing the shared counter.
It acquires the mutex before accessing the counter. 
The verification invariant guarantees safe concurrent access (i.e., the count in the counter doesn't decrease).

@param counter - A pointer to a shared counter object.
