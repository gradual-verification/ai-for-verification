 * Description:
The eloop_loop function runs the given event loop infinitely and makes sure that the property of that event loop is unchanged.
It has a forever loop, and does the following things in the loop: acquiring the lock, getting the handler and data (if the signal count > 0),
releasing the lock and handling the data (if the handler is found.)

@param x: the event loop instance to be run.

It makes sure that x presevees the property of event loop before and after the execution.
