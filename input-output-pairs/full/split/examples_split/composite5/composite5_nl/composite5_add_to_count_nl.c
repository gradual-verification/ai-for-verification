/*add_to_count function
-param: struct node *p, int delta
-description: This function adds the delta value to the count of the node p and its parent nodes,
where count is the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at the node.

It requires that p is non-null and in a tree, and all nodes in its subtree except p itself are valid nodes. 
p's count will be valid after adding delta (>0) to it. So it ensures that the tree is valid after the operation.
