The full IO-pairs

Directory `tutorial_solutions/` includes the example programs in the [VeriFast tutorial solutions](https://github.com/verifast/verifast/tree/master/tutorial_solutions), and `examples/` includes the example programs in the [VeriFast examples](https://github.com/verifast/verifast/tree/master/examples).

In those directories, each single C file `abc.c` is put into a subdirectory with name `abc/`, since we will write other input files (e.g., `abc_nl.c` for NL type, `abc_fb.c` for FB type and `abc_fbp.c` for FB+ type). In `examples/`, the original subdirectories are put into `examples/multi-files/`.
