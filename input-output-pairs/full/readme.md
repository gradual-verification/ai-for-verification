The full IO-pairs, from [VeriFast examples](https://github.com/verifast/verifast/tree/master/examples), [VeriFast tutorial solutions](https://github.com/verifast/verifast/tree/master/tutorial_solutions) (in subdirectory `examples/` of `non-split/` and `split/`), and manually created ones (in subdirectory `DIY/` of `non-split/` and `split/`). 

Directory `non-split/` includes the benchmarks where each file is one module containing multiple functions; Directory `split/` includes the benchmarks where each file focus on one target function in the module; Directory `lib/` contains the default libarary files of VeriFast (provided to LLM); Directory `others/` includes the programs not used (where subdirectory `dropped/` has the programs not used because they are not in Separation Logic or they are repeated, and subdirectory `futures/` contains the programs meeting our standard but we don't have time to create benchmarks for them), which may be provided to LLM in RAG prompting.
