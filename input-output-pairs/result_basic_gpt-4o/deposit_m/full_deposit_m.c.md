To formally verify the given C code using VeriFast, you need to include the proper specifications (i.e., preconditions and postconditions) as well as the predicates needed to express the properties of the program being verified. Here is how you can modify the C code to include formal verification specifications using VeriFast:

```c
#include "stdlib.h"

// Define a predicate for the account structure
//@ predicate account_balance(struct account* a, int b) = a->balance |-> b;

// Account structure definition
struct account {
    int balance;
};

// Function to create a new account
struct account *create_account()
//@ requires true;
//@ ensures account_balance(result, 0) &*& malloc_block_account(result);
{
    struct account *myAccount = malloc(sizeof(struct account));
    if (myAccount == 0)
    {
        abort();
    }
    myAccount->balance = 0;
    //@ close account_balance(myAccount, 0);
    return myAccount;
}

// Function to deposit an amount into an account
void account_deposit(struct account *myAccount, int amount)
/*@ requires account_balance(myAccount, ?theBalance) &*& 0 <= amount 
    &*& theBalance + amount <= INT_MAX &*& theBalance + amount >= INT_MIN; @*/
//@ ensures account_balance(myAccount, theBalance + amount);
{
    myAccount->balance += amount;
    //@ close account_balance(myAccount, theBalance + amount);
}

// Function to get the balance of an account
int account_get_balance(struct account *myAccount)
//@ requires account_balance(myAccount, ?balance);
//@ ensures account_balance(myAccount, balance) &*& result == balance;
{
    int result = myAccount->balance;
    //@ close account_balance(myAccount, balance);
    return result;
}

// Function to set the balance of an account
void account_set_balance(struct account *myAccount, int newBalance)
//@ requires account_balance(myAccount, _);
//@ ensures account_balance(myAccount, newBalance);
{
    myAccount->balance = newBalance;
    //@ close account_balance(myAccount, newBalance);
}

// Function to dispose of an account
void account_dispose(struct account *myAccount)
//@ requires account_balance(myAccount, _) &*& malloc_block_account(myAccount);
//@ ensures true;
{
    //@ open account_balance(myAccount, _);
    free(myAccount);
}

// Main function to demonstrate the account operations
int main()
//@ requires true;
//@ ensures true;
{
    struct account *myAccount = create_account();
    account_set_balance(myAccount, 5);
    account_deposit(myAccount, 10);
    int b = account_get_balance(myAccount);
    assert(b == 15);
    account_dispose(myAccount);
    return 0;
}
```

In this modified code:

- The predicate `account_balance` is defined to represent the state of the `balance` field of the `account` structure.
- In each function where the account structure is accessed, you ensure that the `account_balance` predicate is properly opened before accessing the `balance` field and closed after modifying it.
- The specifications using `@` comments define the preconditions and postconditions for each function, helping VeriFast to understand and verify the program's behavior.
