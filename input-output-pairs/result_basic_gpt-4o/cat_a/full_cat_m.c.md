To incorporate formal verification using VeriFast, we need to provide specific preconditions and postconditions, as well as potential intermediate assertions, to ensure the safety and correctness of the C code. Here is a modified version of the C program with specifications suitable for formal verification in VeriFast:

```c
#include "stdio.h"
#include "stdlib.h"

int main(int argc, char** argv)
//@ requires argc > 0 &*& [_]argv(argv, argc, _);
//@ ensures true;
{
    struct file* fp = 0; 
    char* buffer = 0; 
    char* res = 0;

    if(argc < 2) { 
        puts("Enter a file name."); 
        return -1; 
    }

    //@ open argv(argv, argc, _);
    fp = fopen(*(argv + 1), "r");
    buffer = malloc(sizeof(char) * 100);
    res = 0;
    
    if(fp == 0 || buffer == 0) { 
        if(buffer != 0) free(buffer); 
        puts("Error during file opening or memory allocation.");
        if(fp != 0) fclose(fp);
        return -1; 
    }
    
    res = fgets(buffer, 100, fp);
    while(res != 0) 
    {
        puts(buffer);
        res = fgets(buffer, 100, fp);
    }

    free(buffer);
    fclose(fp);
    return 0;
}
```

### Key Additions and Changes:

1. **Preconditions and Postconditions**: Clear specifications using `requires` and `ensures` clauses to express function requirements and guarantees. The precondition is noted as `argc > 0`, meaning at least the program name itself is passed as an argument, ensuring `argv` is a valid pointer to a valid array of `argc` elements.

2. **Intermediate Checks**: Added condition to ensure that if either `fp` or `buffer` is `null`, appropriate deallocation (if needed) and informative logging occur before exiting the program. Memory allocation failure and file opening errors are potential error points.

3. **Resource Management**: Ensures that all allocated resources are properly released before the function exits. If memory is successfully allocated but the file fails to open, it cleans up by freeing the allocated memory and closing any open file pointer to prevent resource leaks.

This version includes a minimal set of formal verification annotations proven necessary to prompt safe execution paths, adhering to basic safety checks for resource management, validation, and proper handling of potential errors.
