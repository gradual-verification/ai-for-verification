To incorporate Verifast formal verification into your C code, we need to add specific annotations to check for compliance with the expected behavior and memory safety. Below is the modified code block with specifications appropriate for Verifast:

```c
#include "stdio.h"
#include "stdlib.h"

// Verifast will need specific header files for handling the pointers as predicates
#include "vfstdlib.h"

int main(int argc, char** argv) //@ : main
//@ requires argc > 0 &*& [_]argv(argv, argc, _);
//@ ensures true;
{
    struct file* fp = 0;
    char* buffer = 0;
    char* res = 0;
    
    if(argc < 2) {
        puts("Enter a file name.");
        return -1;
    }
    
    fp = fopen(*(argv + 1), "r");
    buffer = malloc(sizeof(char) * 100);
    
    if(fp == 0 || buffer == 0) {
        if (buffer != 0) free(buffer);
        if (fp != 0) fclose(fp);
        abort();
    }
    
    //@ close chars(buffer, 100, _);
    
    res = fgets(buffer, 100, fp);
    while(res != 0) 
    {
        puts(buffer);
        //@ close chars(res, 100, _);
        res = fgets(buffer, 100, fp);
    }
    
    //@ open chars(buffer, 100, _);
    free(buffer);
    fclose(fp);
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Header Files**: Added `#include "vfstdlib.h"` because Verifast requires additional library support for handling predicates with file operations and memory management.

2. **Predicates**:
    - `chars(buffer, 100, _)` is used to denote that `buffer` is a valid character array of size 100. The placeholder `_` indicates that the content's actual values are ignored for verification purposes.

3. **Conditional Resource Management**:
    - If an abort situation arises (e.g., failed memory allocation), we ensure any allocated resources are freed and closed, preventing resource leaks.
  
4. **Verification Annotations**: 
    - `@ close chars(buffer, 100, _);` before starting the `fgets` loop indicates to Verifast that `buffer` now has valid data which safeguards sequential reasoning legality.
    - `@ open chars(buffer, 100, _);` before freeing asserts the access to the buffer operations, avoiding potential mismatch errors in memory operations.

Remember to run this version with Verifast toolchain to verify the correctness of your annotations and ensure memory safety and proper use of resources through the formal verification process provided by Verifast.
