To perform a formal verification with VeriFast, you need to include specific annotations that express preconditions, postconditions, and invariants. Below is the C code with VeriFast annotations to verify the program's correctness:

```c
#include "stdlib.h"
#include "stdio.h"
#include <stdbool.h>
#include "assert.h"

int main(int argc, char** argv) //@ : main
//@ requires argc >= 0 &*& [_]argv(argv, argc, _);
//@ ensures true;
{
    struct file* from = 0; 
    struct file* to = 0; 
    char* buffer = 0; 
    int nb_read = 0;

    if(argc < 3) { 
        puts("Not enough parameters."); 
        return -1; 
    }
    
    from = fopen(argv[1], "r");
    to = fopen(argv[2], "w");
    buffer = malloc(100);
    
    if(buffer == 0 || from == 0 || to == 0) { 
        abort(); 
    }
    
    //@ assert buffer != 0;
    //@ assert from != 0;
    //@ assert to != 0;
    
    nb_read = fread(buffer, 1, 100, from);
    
    while(0 < nb_read)
    //@ invariant buffer != 0 &*& from != 0 &*& to != 0;
    {
        int nb_written = fwrite(buffer, 1, nb_read, to);
        //@ assert nb_written == nb_read; // Check that all bytes read are written
        nb_read = fread(buffer, 1, 100, from);
    }
    
    fclose(from);
    fclose(to);
    free(buffer);
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Preconditions and Postconditions**:
   - The precondition `requires argc >= 0 &*& [_]argv(argv, argc, _);` ensures that `argc` is non-negative and that `argv` is a valid array of arguments.
   - The postcondition `ensures true;` ensures that the function exits correctly.
   
2. **Invariants**:
   - An invariant is provided within the while loop: `buffer != 0 &*& from != 0 &*& to != 0;` which ensures that the pointers `buffer`, `from`, and `to` remain valid throughout the loop execution.
   
3. **Assertions**:
   - Assertions like `assert buffer != 0;`, `assert from != 0;`, and `assert to != 0;` confirm that the memory allocations and file opening operations are successful before proceeding.
   - `assert nb_written == nb_read;` confirms that the number of bytes written matches the number of bytes read, ensuring data integrity.

By using VeriFast annotations, you can verify that resources like memory allocations and file operations are handled correctly, and that the program terminates correctly without resource leaks or assertion failures.
