Below is the modified code with formal verification specifications using VeriFast. We will include the necessary details to allow VeriFast to verify that the function `fill` correctly writes character `c` to the array `buf`.

```c
#include "stdlib.h" // Ensure inclusion of standard library for size_t

/*@
fixpoint list<t> n_times<t>(t x, int count) {
    return count == 0 ? nil : cons(x, n_times(x, count - 1));
}

lemma void n_times_length<t>(t x, int count)
    requires count >= 0;
    ensures length(n_times(x, count)) == count;
{
    switch(count) {
        case 0:
        case succ(n):
            n_times_length(x, n);
    }
}
@*/

void fill(char *buf, int length, char c)
//@ requires chars(buf, length, ?oldChars);
//@ ensures chars(buf, length, n_times(c, length));
{
    //@ n_times_length(c, length);
    for (int i = 0; i < length; i++)
    //@ invariant chars(buf, i, n_times(c, i)) &*& chars(buf + i, length - i, drop(i, oldChars));
    {
        buf[i] = c;
        //@ assert chars(buf, i + 1, append(n_times(c, i), cons(c, nil)));
        //@ open chars(buf + i, length - i, drop(i, oldChars));
    }
}

int main()
//@ requires true;
//@ ensures true;
{
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Predicates and Annotations**: We've added annotations to provide a detailed specification of the state of the buffer (`buf`) before and after the function `fill` is executed. The predicate `chars(buf, length, list_of_characters)` is used by VeriFast to reason about the contents of the buffer across the iterations of the loop in the `fill` function.

- **Fixpoint Function `n_times`**: The fixpoint function, `n_times`, has been defined to generate a list containing the character `c` repeated `length` times.

- **Lemma for Length Verification**: A lemma, `n_times_length`, is employed to guarantee the length of the list produced by `n_times` matches the expected count.

- **Loop Invariant and Assertions**: The loop invariant ensures that before each iteration, the buffer from the start to position `i` contains the character `c`, and after addressing `buf[i]`, the invariant is updated to reflect that `c` now occupies an additional element in the sequence.

By including these specifications and proofs, VeriFast can verify the functionality and correctness of the `fill` method formally.
