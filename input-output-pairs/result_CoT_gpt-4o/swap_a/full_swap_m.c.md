To formalize the verification of the given C code using VeriFast, we need to specify preconditions, postconditions, and loop invariants (where applicable) according to the given steps. The following is the modified C code with the appropriate specifications:

```c
#include "stdlib.h"
#include <stdbool.h>

// Swap function: Swaps the values of two integers.
void swap(int *a, int *b)
//@ requires integer(a, ?x) &*& integer(b, ?y);
//@ ensures integer(a, y) &*& integer(b, x);
{
    // The function swaps the integers pointed by 'a' and 'b'.
    int tmp = *a;
    *a = *b;
    *b = tmp;
}

// Define structure 'point' to represent a point with coordinates (x, y).
struct point {
    int x;
    int y;
};

// Point mirror function: Mirrors a point by swapping its x and y coordinates.
void point_mirror(struct point *p)
//@ requires p->x |-> ?x &*& p->y |-> ?y;
//@ ensures p->x |-> y &*& p->y |-> x;
{
    // The function uses 'swap' to exchange the x and y values of a point.
    swap(&p->x, &p->y);
}

int main() //@ : main
//@ requires true;
//@ ensures true;
{
    // Allocate memory for a point structure.
    struct point *p = malloc(sizeof(struct point));
    if (p == 0) { abort(); }
    
    // Assign initial values to point coordinates.
    p->x = 3;
    p->y = 10;
    
    // Mirror the point by swapping its coordinates.
    point_mirror(p);
    
    // Assert that the coordinates have been correctly swapped.
    bool b = p->x == 10 && p->y == 3;
    assert(b);
    
    // Free the allocated memory.
    free(p);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preconditions and Postconditions:**
   - For the `swap` function, the precondition requires that `a` points to an integer `x` and `b` points to an integer `y`. The postcondition ensures that after the swap, `a` will point to the integer value of `y` and `b` will point to the integer value of `x`.

   - For the `point_mirror` function, the precondition requires access to the `x` and `y` fields of a `point` structure pointer `p`. The postcondition ensures that these fields are swapped correctly.

2. **Main Function:**
   - The `main` function doesn't require a precondition since it has the default `requires true;` and ensures `true;`, signifying that nothing specific needs to be true before or after execution concerning memory safety or values, beyond what's asserted in the program.

Note: The code as provided doesn't have loops, so there is no need for loop invariants here. The code specification focuses on basic memory safety and correctness of the swapping operations.
