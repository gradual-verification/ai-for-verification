When integrating formal verification using VeriFast into your C program, the main goals are to ensure memory safety, integer bounds checking, and the correctness of your functional logic. Below is the modified code, complete with VeriFast annotations:

```c
#include "stdlib.h"

struct account
{
    int balance;
};

/*@ predicate account(struct account *a; int balance) = 
    a != 0 &*& a->balance |-> balance; @*/

/*@
    requires true;
    ensures account(result, 0);
@*/
struct account *create_account()
{
    struct account *myAccount = malloc(sizeof(struct account));
    if (myAccount == 0)
    {
        abort();
    }
    
    myAccount->balance = 0;
    return myAccount;
}

/*@
    requires account(myAccount, ?b) &*& amount >= 0;
    ensures account(myAccount, b + amount);
@*/
void account_deposit(struct account *myAccount, int amount)
{
    myAccount->balance += amount;
}

/*@
    requires account(myAccount, ?b);
    ensures account(myAccount, b) &*& result == b;
@*/
int account_get_balance(struct account *myAccount)
{
    int result = myAccount->balance;
    return result;
}

/*@
    requires account(myAccount, _);
    ensures account(myAccount, newBalance);
@*/
void account_set_balance(struct account *myAccount, int newBalance)
{
    myAccount->balance = newBalance;
}

/*@
    requires account(myAccount, _);
    ensures true;
@*/
void account_dispose(struct account *myAccount)
{
    free(myAccount);
}

/*@
    requires true;
    ensures true;
@*/
int main()
{
    struct account *myAccount = create_account();
    account_set_balance(myAccount, 5);
    account_deposit(myAccount, 10);
    int b = account_get_balance(myAccount);
    assert(b == 15);
    account_dispose(myAccount);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Predicates**: Describes the state of an account object, including its validity and balance.

2. **Preconditions and Postconditions**:
   - For `create_account`, the postcondition ensures that a new account is created with a balance of 0.
   - For `account_deposit`, the precondition ensures that the deposit amount is non-negative, and the postcondition updates the account balance correctly.
   - For `account_get_balance`, we verify that the function does not modify the state of the account.
   - For `account_set_balance`, the balance is set to `newBalance`, captured in the postcondition.
   - For `account_dispose`, we require the account object to be valid for deallocation.

3. **Memory Safety**: Ensured by the predicates, which hold the properties of pointer validity whenever they are accessed or modified.

This C code is structured for verification with VeriFast, preserving memory safety and correctness of operations on the `account` structure.
