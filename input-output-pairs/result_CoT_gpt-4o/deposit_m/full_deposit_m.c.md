Explanation:
- **Predicate `account_balance`:** A predicate is defined to represent the balance of an account and is used in preconditions and postconditions.
- **Memory safety and integer bound checks:** We include conditions to ensure that the balance does not overflow (`INT_MAX`) or underflow (`INT_MIN`).
- **Open/Close Statements:** These predicates are opened and closed to manipulate and assert balance values safely and verify conditions.
- **Verification Steps:**
    - Create, set, deposit, get, and dispose functions all include appropriate preconditions and postconditions to ensure that every state of the `account` object is verified for safety and mathematical correctness.
    - We assert that the final balance after operations is correct by using the `assert` statement in `main()`.
