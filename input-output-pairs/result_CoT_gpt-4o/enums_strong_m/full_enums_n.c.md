To formally verify the provided C code using VeriFast, you need to write appropriate specifications, including function preconditions and postconditions, loop invariants, and auxiliary specifications. Below is the modified code with all these elements in place:

```c
#include <assert.h>
#include <limits.h>

// VeriFast definitions
//@ #include <bitops.gh>

// Enums
enum day
{
  monday,
  tuesday,
  wednesday,
  thursday,
  friday,
  saturday,
  sunday
};

enum large_numbers
{
  large_number = 30000,
  another_large_number,
  yaln = -0x7fff - 1
};

/*@
  // Precondition and Postcondition for next_day
  Requires: valid_day(d);
  Ensures: valid_day(result);
  Predicate valid_day(int d) = 0 <= d && d <= 6;
@*/

/***
 * Description:
 * The next_day function calculates the next day given a current day.
 *
 * @param day d - represents the current day, which is in the range of [0, 6].
 *
 * The function calculates the next day by adding 1 to 
 * the current day, taking the result modulo 7 to handle looping 
 * back to Monday after Sunday. Finally, the function returns 
 * the next day as an enum day type, ensuring that the result is 
 * within the valid range of 0 to 6.
 */
enum day next_day(enum day d)
  //@ requires valid_day(d);
  //@ ensures valid_day(result);
{
  // No actual loop, just condition checks to validate results
  if (d == sunday) {
    return monday; // Explicit return for clarity
  } else {
    return (d + 1) % 7;
  }
}

/*@
  // Main does not have specific requirements, assertions ensure logic
  Ensures: true;
@*/

/***
 * Description:
 * The main function assigns an integer to a enum day variable, 
 * and checks the value of items in enum large_numbers.
 */
int main()
  //@ ensures true;
{
  enum day d = monday;
  
  // Trying to assign a value outside the enum's range
  // This demonstrates what happens but would probably be considered invalid usage.
  d = 35; // Note: usually not advised due to out-of-range issues.
  int x = d;

  assert(large_number == 30000);
  assert(another_large_number == 30001);
  assert(yaln + 1 == -0x7fff);
  return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Enum definitions**: These remain unchanged but are referred to in the specification.
  
2. **next_day function**:
   - **Precondition**: 
     - A predicate `valid_day` is defined to ensure the input enum day value remains within its correct bounds [0, 6].
   - **Postcondition**:
     - Ensures that the return value is also a valid `enum day` by using the same `valid_day` predicate.
   
3. **main function**:
   - Although main doesn't take parameters or return meaningful computations pertaining to the enum, the `ensures` clause is set to `true` as it confirms that execution reaches this point without violating any assertions.
   - Memory safety and bounds checks are inherently handled through assertions and boundaries defined within functions.

This specification ensures that the function `next_day` respects input and output conditions within the permissible range, while other operations in `main` are protected by using assertions to confirm constant values.
