Below is the complete code with formal verification conditions added using VeriFast:

```c
#include "stdlib.h"

// Predicate representing the state of an account with a known balance.
predicate account_balance(struct account *a; int b) =
    a->balance |-> b;

// Structure representing an account.
struct account {
    int balance;
};

// Create an account with an initial balance of 0.
//@ requires true;
//@ ensures account_balance(result, 0);
struct account *create_account() 
{
    struct account *myAccount = malloc(sizeof(struct account));
    if (myAccount == 0)
    {
        abort();
    }
    myAccount->balance = 0;
    //@ close account_balance(myAccount, 0);
    return myAccount;
}

// Set the balance of the given account.
//@ requires account_balance(myAccount, _);
//@ ensures account_balance(myAccount, newBalance);
void account_set_balance(struct account *myAccount, int newBalance) 
{
    //@ open account_balance(myAccount, _);
    myAccount->balance = newBalance;
    //@ close account_balance(myAccount, newBalance);
}

// Dispose of an account, releasing its memory.
//@ requires account_balance(myAccount, _);
//@ ensures true;
void account_dispose(struct account *myAccount) 
{
    //@ open account_balance(myAccount, _);
    free(myAccount);
}

// Main function that demonstrates creating, modifying, and disposing of an account.
//@ requires true;
//@ ensures true;
int main() 
{
    struct account *myAccount = create_account();
    account_set_balance(myAccount, 5);
    account_dispose(myAccount);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Predicates**: A predicate `account_balance` is declared to represent the balance of a `struct account`. It is important for encoding the state of the account for verification.

2. **Functions**:
   - **`create_account`**: Initializes an account with balance `0`. The precondition and postcondition specify that initially nothing is required and after execution, an account with balance `0` is returned.
   - **`account_set_balance`**: Updates the balance of the account. The precondition ensures that an account with any balance is provided, and the postcondition ensures that after execution, the account's balance is updated to `newBalance`.
   - **`account_dispose`**: Frees the allocated memory for an account, ensuring that no memory leaks occur.

3. **Main function**: Demonstratively creates, sets balance, and disposes of an account, with preconditions and postconditions ensuring correctness throughout.

In the specifications:
- `open` and `close` statements manage the opening and closing of predicates, which is crucial for the precise tracking of memory and state in the verification process.
- Each function has clearly defined preconditions and postconditions to capture necessary correctness properties such as memory safety and correct behavior regarding account balances.
