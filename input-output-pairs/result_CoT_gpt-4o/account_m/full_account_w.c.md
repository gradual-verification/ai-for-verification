Certainly! Below is the C code block with added formal verification annotations for use with VeriFast. The code includes specifications for preconditions and postconditions, predicates, and loop invariants (if applicable) according to your guideline:

```c
#include "stdlib.h"

//@ predicate account_balance(struct account *acc, int balance) = acc->balance |-> balance;

struct account {
    int balance;
};

struct account *create_account()
//@ requires true;
//@ ensures account_balance(result, 0) &*& result != 0;
{
    struct account *myAccount = malloc(sizeof(struct account));
    if (myAccount == 0) {
        abort();
    }
    myAccount->balance = 0;
    //@ close account_balance(myAccount, 0);
    return myAccount;
}

void account_set_balance(struct account *myAccount, int newBalance)
//@ requires account_balance(myAccount, _);
//@ ensures account_balance(myAccount, newBalance);
{
    //@ open account_balance(myAccount, _);
    myAccount->balance = newBalance;
    //@ close account_balance(myAccount, newBalance);
}

void account_dispose(struct account *myAccount)
//@ requires account_balance(myAccount, _);
//@ ensures true;
{
    //@ open account_balance(myAccount, _);
    free(myAccount);
}

int main()
//@ requires true;
//@ ensures true;
{
    struct account *myAccount = create_account();
    account_set_balance(myAccount, 5);
    account_dispose(myAccount);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Predicate Definition**: 
   - `predicate account_balance(struct account *acc, int balance)` is used to specify the ownership and current balance of an account. It is defined as tracking the `balance` field within a struct `account`.

2. **Preconditions and Postconditions**:
   - **`create_account`:** Ensures the resulting account has a balance of `0` and is not null (`result != 0`).
   - **`account_set_balance`:** The precondition (`account_balance(myAccount, _)`) allows updating the balance, and the postcondition updates the predicate with the new balance.
   - **`account_dispose`:** The precondition requires the account's balance, and it does not return anything specific (just `ensures true;`).
   
3. **Memory Management**:
   - Memory allocation is checked for success (`result != 0`).
   - Allocation and deallocation predicates handle the `malloc` and `free` functions safely.
  
4. **Open/Close Annotations**:
   - These annotations manage the lifecycle of the predicates, where `open` is used to access the current state, and `close` is used to state the preservation of the new state. 

This formatting and setup enable the VeriFast tool to check the function's correctness regarding both memory safety and business logic (ensuring correct balance management).
