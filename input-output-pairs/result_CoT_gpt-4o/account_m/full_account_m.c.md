To include formal code verification in this C code using VeriFast, we need to follow the steps outlined in the task. The complete code including the specifications is provided below:

```c
#include "stdlib.h"

// Define the predicate to represent an account's balance
//@ predicate account_balance(struct account *acc, int balance) = acc->balance |-> balance;

struct account
{
    int balance;
};

struct account *create_account()
//@ requires true;
//@ ensures account_balance(result, 0) &*& malloc_block_account(result);
{
    struct account *myAccount = malloc(sizeof(struct account));
    if (myAccount == 0)
    {
        abort();
    }
    myAccount->balance = 0;
    //@ close account_balance(myAccount, 0);
    return myAccount;
}

void account_set_balance(struct account *myAccount, int newBalance)
//@ requires account_balance(myAccount, _);
//@ ensures account_balance(myAccount, newBalance);
{
    //@ open account_balance(myAccount, _);
    myAccount->balance = newBalance;
    //@ close account_balance(myAccount, newBalance);
}

void account_dispose(struct account *myAccount)
//@ requires account_balance(myAccount, _) &*& malloc_block_account(myAccount);
//@ ensures true;
{
    //@ open account_balance(myAccount, _);
    free(myAccount);
}

int main()
//@ requires true;
//@ ensures true;
{
    struct account *myAccount = create_account();
    account_set_balance(myAccount, 5);
    account_dispose(myAccount);
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:** 

- **Predicates:**
  - `account_balance`: This predicate represents the logical state of the `balance` field within an `account` structure, ensuring that any manipulation of this field outside its abstraction is done through specific operations with appropriate specifications.

- **Function Specifications:**
  - Each function is annotated with its preconditions and postconditions, defining the logical state before and after execution.
  - `create_account` ensures the newly created account has a balance of 0 and the memory is correctly managed using `malloc_block_account`.

- **Loop Invariant:**
  - There is no loop in this code, so no loop invariants are necessary.

- **Open and Close Statements:**
  - These are used respectively to reveal and conceal the abstract representation of a predicate like `account_balance`, ensuring that modifications to `balance` are tracked accurately by VeriFast.

This setup allows VeriFast to verify the correctness of the code concerning memory safety, correct usage of the predicates, and integer bounds (if relevant).
