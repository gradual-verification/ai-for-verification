This code has been annotated with VeriFast annotations to provide a formal verification. I've added preconditions and postconditions to both functions, defined the `counter` predicate, used `close` and `open` statements for memory predicates, and ensured memory safety with `malloc_block_counter`. Note that preconditions make sure that the global pointer `c` is not `null` before invoking `m`, and postconditions ensure the correctness of `c->f` incrementation. The assertions check the expected outcomes, and the `leak` statement handles resource leak prevention in VeriFast.
