Here is the C code with proper VeriFast annotations to specify and verify the functional correctness and memory safety of the code:

```c
#include "stdlib.h"

static int x;

struct counter {
    int f;
};

// Predicate for the struct counter
// Represents ownership and encapsulates the invariants related to 'f'
predicate counter_f(struct counter *ctr, int v) =
    ctr != 0 &*& ctr->f |-> v &*& v >= INT_MIN &*& v <= INT_MAX;

static struct counter *c;

void m()
//@ requires x |-> 7 &*& c |-> ?ctr &*& counter_f(ctr, ?v) &*& v >= INT_MIN &*& v + 1 <= INT_MAX;
//@ ensures x |-> 8 &*& c |-> ctr &*& counter_f(ctr, v + 1);
{
    // Open the counter_f predicate to access fields of 'ctr'
    //@ open counter_f(ctr, v);
    int y = x;
    x = y + 1;
    ctr->f = ctr->f + 1;
    // Close the counter_f predicate after modifying the field
    //@ close counter_f(ctr, v + 1);
}

int main() //@ : main_full(globals_m)
//@ requires module(globals_m, true);
//@ ensures true;
{
    x = 7;
    struct counter *ctr = malloc(sizeof(struct counter));
    if (ctr == 0) abort();

    // Initialize the struct counter and establish its predicate
    ctr->f = 42;
    //@ close counter_f(ctr, 42);

    c = ctr;
    m();

    // Having called m(), the predicate counter_f(ctr, 43) should hold
    int ctr_f = ctr->f;
    assert(ctr_f == 43);

    // Open the counter_f predicate to release ownership before freeing memory
    //@ open counter_f(ctr, 43);
    free(ctr);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Predicate Definition**: A predicate `counter_f` is defined for the `struct counter` that encapsulates the ownership and invariants relating to the `f` field ensuring bounds checks are handled safely.

2. **Preconditions & Postconditions**: 
   - Function `m`: Specifies that initially `x` is 7 and `c` points to a `counter` with a field value `v`, which is safely incrementable (considering integer bounds). The postcondition ensures `x` becomes 8 and `c` points to the same counter with an incremented field `v + 1`.
   - Function `main`: It sets up the memory and predicates necessary to call `m` safely and asserts the final state.

3. **Open/Close/Predicate Management**:
   - `open` and `close` statements are used to manipulate the `counter_f` predicate to modify and then re-establish assertions around the `counter` structure.
   
This specification ensures that operations on both global and dynamically allocated memory are checked for correctness and safety, while maintaining adherence to the logical model required by VeriFast.
