Certainly! Below is the given C code modified with formal code verification specifications using VeriFast annotations. These annotations include preconditions, postconditions, loop invariants, and necessary VeriFast statements to ensure the correctness and safety of the code.

```c
/*@
  // Predicate representing an integer range from 0 to n-1
  predicate range(int n;) =
    0 <= n;

  // Precondition: n must be non-negative
  requires range(n);
  // Postcondition: result is the sum of all numbers from 0 to n-1
  ensures result == n * (n - 1) / 2;

@*/
int sum_of_range(int n)
{
    int count = 0;
    int sum = 0;
    /*@
      // Loop invariant: 
      // 1. 0 <= count <= n - Invariant that count stays within valid bounds
      // 2. sum == count * (count - 1) / 2 - Correctness condition (sum matches the expected sum of integers up to count-1)
      loop_invariant 0 <= count <= n;
      loop_invariant sum == count * (count - 1) / 2;
      // Ensures sum doesn't exceed integer limits
      ensures sum <= n * (n - 1) / 2;
    @*/
    while (count != n)
    {
        //@ open range(n);
        sum = sum + count;
        count = count + 1;
        //@ close range(n);
    }
    return sum;
}

int main()
{
    //@ open range(0);
    return 0;
    //@ close range(0);
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Predicates**: A predicate `range(int n;)` is defined to indicate that `n` is non-negative. It helps to ensure memory safety and integer bounds.

- **Precondition and Postcondition**: The precondition `requires range(n);` checks for non-negativity of `n`. The postcondition `ensures result == n * (n - 1) / 2;` confirms that the result is the correct sum of numbers from 0 to `n-1`.

- **Loop Invariant**: 
  - `0 <= count <= n`: Ensures that `count` stays within bounds.
  - `sum == count * (count - 1) / 2`: Ensures correctness by maintaining that `sum` at any point is the sum of all numbers from 0 to `count-1`.
  - `ensures sum <= n * (n - 1) / 2;`: Ensures that `sum` calculated in the loop doesn't exceed the maximal value `n*(n-1)/2`, maintaining integer bounds.

- **Open/Close Predicate**: VeriFast utilizes `open` and `close` statements to modify assumptions about predicates before and after they are used.

This specification guarantees that the function behaves correctly and safely according to its specification, assuming the verification tool and implementation handle the constraints properly.
