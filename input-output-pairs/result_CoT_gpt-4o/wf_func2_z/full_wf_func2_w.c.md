In the code:

1. **Precondition and Postcondition for `fill` function**:
   - Precondition specifies that the `length` should be non-negative and the `buf` array should be initialized with `length` characters.
   - Postcondition specifies that after execution, the `buf` array will be filled with the character `c`.

2. **Loop Invariant**:
   - The loop invariant ensures that `i` is always between 0 and `length`, ensuring safe access to `buf`.

3. **Memory Safety and Integer Bounds**:
   - The loop invariant additionally ensures safe memory access during each iteration.

The precondition and postcondition are embedded using Verifast syntax (`requires` and `ensures`). The loop invariant is verified at every iteration to ensure the conditions are satisfied throughout the loop execution.
