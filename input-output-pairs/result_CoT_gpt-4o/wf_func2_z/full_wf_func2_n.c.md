Here's the modified C code with formal verification in Verifast:

```c
/*@

predicate buffer(char *buf, int length, list<char> contents) =
    length == 0 ?
        contents == nil :
        // Represent the buffer as a list holding its contents
        chars(buf, length, ?cs) &*&
        contents == cs;

@*/

/**

* Description:

The `fill` function fills a buffer with a specified character up to a given length.

@param buf - A pointer to a character buffer.
@param length - An integer specifying the number of positions in the buffer to fill.
@param c - A character that will be used to fill the buffer.

The behavior goes below:
The function iterates from 0 to length - 1.
In each iteration, it assigns the character c to the current position in the buffer.

*/

/*@
requires buffer(buf, length, ?contents) &*& 0 <= length &*& INT_MIN <= length &*& length <= INT_MAX;
ensures buffer(buf, length, ?new_contents) &*& new_contents == repeat(c, length);
@*/
void fill(char *buf, int length, char c)
    //@ requires buffer(buf, length, ?contents) &*& 0 <= length &*& INT_MIN <= length &*& length <= INT_MAX;
    //@ ensures buffer(buf, length, ?new_contents) &*& new_contents == repeat(c, length);
{
    //@ open buffer(buf, length, contents);
    for (int i = 0; i < length; i++)
        //@ invariant chars(buf, length, ?cs) &*& i <= length &*& cs == append(repeat(c, i), drop(i, contents));
    {
        buf[i] = c;
        //@ open chars(buf, length, cs);
        //@ close chars(buf, length, update(i, c, cs));
    }
    //@ close buffer(buf, length, repeat(c, length));
}

int main()
    //@ requires true;
    //@ ensures true;
{
    return 0;
}
```

In this code:
1. A predicate `buffer` is defined to describe the state of the buffer as a list of characters.
2. The `fill` function is annotated with a precondition and postcondition that use this predicate.
3. Loop invariants ensure the buffer's state is correctly modified across iterations.
4. The code handles memory safety and integer bounds through the function's assumptions and loop invariants.
