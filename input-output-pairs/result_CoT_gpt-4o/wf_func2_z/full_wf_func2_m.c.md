In the code above:
- I've defined a predicate `valid_buffer` that serves as a precondition to ensure the buffer is valid for the specified length.
- The `fill` function's requires and ensures clauses are set such that the function requires the initial buffer to be valid and ensures it is filled with a specific character after execution.
- A loop invariant is used within the `for` loop to establish and preserve key conditions that allow for the postcondition to be proven. The invariant specifies the state of the `chars` in the buffer as it progresses through each iteration.
- `open` and `close` statements are used to manipulate the state of the buffer's predicate, effectively transforming the conditions needed for the loop's progress and subsequent postcondition verification.
