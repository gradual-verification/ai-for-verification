To apply formal verification in VeriFast to the given C code, you need to define appropriate preconditions, postconditions, loop invariants, predicates, and other verification statements. Hereâ€™s how you would modify the code to include these components:

```c
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

struct student {
    char name[100];
    int age;
};

/*@
predicate students(struct student *students, int count) =
    count == 0 ?
        true
    :
        students->name[..100] |-> ?cs &*& mem('\0', cs) == true &*& students->age |-> _ &*&
        struct_student_padding(students) &*&
        students(students + 1, count - 1);
@*/

struct student *read_students(int *count)
//@ requires *count |-> _;
//@ ensures *count |-> ?nb &*& students(result, nb) &*& malloc_block_students(result, nb) &*& nb >= 0;
{
    printf("How many students?\n");
    scanf(" %d", count);
    if (*count < 0 || SIZE_MAX / sizeof(struct student) < (size_t)*count) abort();
    struct student *result = malloc(*count * sizeof(struct student));
    if (result == 0) abort();
    //@ close students(result, *count);
    for (int i = 0; i < *count; i++)
    //@ invariant students(result, *count);
    {
        printf("Please enter the name of student %d:\n", i);
        if (scanf(" %99s", &result[i].name) != 1) abort();
        printf("Please enter the age of student %d:\n", i);
        scanf(" %d", &result[i].age);
    }
    //@ close students(result, *count);
    return result;
}

struct point {
    int x;
    int y;
};

int main() //@ : main
//@ requires true;
//@ ensures true;
{
    if (SIZE_MAX / 2 < sizeof(struct point)) abort();
    struct point *points = malloc(2 * sizeof(struct point));
    if (points == 0) abort();
    points[0].x = 10;
    points[0].y = 20;
    points[1].x = 30;
    points[1].y = 40;
    free((void *)points); 
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Preconditions and Postconditions**: 
   - For `read_students`, we require that `count` points to a valid integer location (as denoted by `*count |-> _`).
   - The postcondition ensures that `result` points to an array of `student` structs that matches the number specified by `count`, that all allocations have been successfully made, and `count >= 0`.

2. **Loop Invariants**:
   - A loop invariant for the process of filling in student data is specified using the predicate `students`. It ensures the validity of the `students` data structure at each iteration.

3. **Open and Close Statements**:
   - Use `close` statements to assert that memory predicates hold at specific points in the code.

4. **Memory Safety**:
   - Ensure allocation sizes do not exceed limits by checking against `SIZE_MAX`.

5. **Lemmas and Leak Statements**:
   - Not used directly in this example but would be used for proving conditions that involve complex properties or cleanup tasks in verification.

The predicates, loop invariants, and assertions make it easier for VeriFast to verify correctness regarding memory usage and logical correctness in loops. The `students` predicate defines structure integrity, memory layout, and validity constraints.
