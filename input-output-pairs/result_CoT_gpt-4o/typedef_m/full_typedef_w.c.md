Here is a modified version of the C code with added formal verification annotations for VeriFast:

```c
typedef int my_int;

// Predicate and functions declarations
//@ predicate my_int_valid(my_int x) = x >= INT_MIN && x <= INT_MAX;

int main()
//@ requires true;
//@ ensures true;
{
    my_int x = 5;
    //@ close my_int_valid(x);
    
    int y = x;
    //@ assert my_int_valid(x);  // Ensure x is a valid my_int
    
    my_int z = 3;
    //@ close my_int_valid(z);
    
    my_int t = x + z;
    //@ assert my_int_valid(t);  // Ensure t is a valid my_int

    assert(t == 8);
    
    //@ leak my_int_valid(x);  // Leak memory predicate x
    //@ leak my_int_valid(z);  // Leak memory predicate z
    //@ leak my_int_valid(t);  // Leak memory predicate t
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Precondition and Postcondition**:
   - Precondition and postcondition are left as `true` since `main` does not require specific preconditions or postconditions.

2. **Predicates**:
   - A predicate `my_int_valid` is defined to ensure an `int` value is within bounds. This is relevant for memory safety and integer bound checks.

3. **Assertions**:
   - Throughout the `main` function, assertions ensure that the variables `x`, `z`, and `t` are within the valid range of an `int`.

4. **Leak Statements**:
   - Leak statements are used at the end of the function to properly close out the predicate context within VeriFast. These are necessary for memory management in verification tools even though they may not directly translate to practical coding concepts.

5. **Predicate Usage**:
   - The `close` statement is used to concretize that a certain instance of `my_int` satisfies the predicate.

This example maintains the simplicity of the original function while ensuring memory safety and integer validity through VeriFast's formal verification processes.
