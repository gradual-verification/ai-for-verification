Certainly! Below is the modified C code with Verifast specifications including preconditions, postconditions, and necessary annotations. The program sets up basic type aliases and performs integer operations with assertions to verify expected values.

```c
typedef int my_int;

int main()
//@ requires true;
//@ ensures true;
{
    my_int x = 5;
    int y = x;
    my_int z = 3;
    my_int t = x + z;
    assert(t == 8); // This checks if the calculated value matches the expected result
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Preconditions and Postconditions:**

   - The precondition `requires true;` indicates that no special conditions need to be satisfied before running `main`.
   - The postcondition `ensures true;` signifies that no particular conditions are guaranteed after `main` finishes besides termination without runtime errors.

2. **Memory Safety:**

   - The code only involves basic stack-allocated integers, which are memory-safe, assuming C's standard semantics.

3. **Assertions:**

   - The `assert(t == 8);` statement checks whether the variable `t` has the expected value, which acts as a postcondition and a runtime check ensuring functional correctness.

Since the code does not involve loops, there are no loop invariants to define. The types used are basic integers, so no additional predicates or definitions are necessary beyond the basic integer type alias. Also, as the operations are limited to simple addition and direct assignments, there are no intricate preconditions or transformations required.
