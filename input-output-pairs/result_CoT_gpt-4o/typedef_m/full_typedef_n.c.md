To perform formal verification of the C code using VeriFast, we need to specify preconditions, postconditions, and loop invariants (if applicable) and add necessary statements to handle predicates and memory access. Here is the complete code with the required specifications:

```c
typedef int my_int;

/*@ 

// There are no specific predicates or data structures needed in this case other than basic arithmetic checks.

/*@ 
    // Precondition: None because main does not take any input parameters. Also, there are no global state dependencies.
    requires true; 
    // Postcondition: The function will always return 0 and memory safety is guaranteed. Ensure that the arithmetic result matches an expected condition.
    ensures result == 0 && \old(t == 8);
@*/
int main()
{
    my_int x = 5;
    int y = x;
    my_int z = 3;
    my_int t = x + z;

    // Assertion to ensure functional behavior is preserved.
    assert(t == 8);
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Precondition and Postcondition**:
  - `requires true;` is used because the `main` function doesn't take arguments or depend on any initial state that needs preconditions.
  - `ensures result == 0 && \old(t == 8);` is stated to guarantee the outcome of `main()` (return value 0) and check that the calculation of `t` results in 8.

- **Assertions**:
  - `assert(t == 8);` ensures that the program's logic performs as expected and matches our verification logic in the postcondition. 

### Additional Considerations:
- All variable types and operations are safe, as they use basic integer arithmetic and types defined within the code.
- No loop invariants are necessary since there are no loops in the code.
- `open`, `close`, `lemma`, and `leak` statements are not needed in this simple example, as we do not manipulate any custom predicates or complex data structures that require opening or closing logical implications.
  
This setup efficiently demonstrates the use of formal verification for a simple C program using VeriFast, confirming logical assertions about arithmetic outcomes.
