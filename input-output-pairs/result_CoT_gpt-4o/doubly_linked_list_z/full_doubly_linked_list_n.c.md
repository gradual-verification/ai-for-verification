To incorporate formal verification in the C code using VeriFast, we need to define preconditions and postconditions for functions, as well as loop invariants for the loop found in the `reverse` function. Here's how the code can be rewritten with the necessary annotations:

```c
#include "verifast.h"

typedef struct node {
    int item;
    struct node *next;
    struct node *prev;
} *node;

typedef struct dllist {
    node head;
    node tail;
} *dllist;

/*@
predicate nodes(node n) =
    n == 0 ? true : nodes(n->next);

predicate dllist(dllist l) =
    nodes(l->head) &*& l->tail != 0;
@*/

/***
 * Description:
 * The `reverse` function reverses the order of nodes in a doubly linked list.
 *
 * @param arg - The doubly linked list to be reversed.
 * @requires - The argument `arg` must be a valid doubly linked list.
 * @ensures - The order of nodes in the doubly linked list pointed to by `arg` is reversed.
 */
/*@
requires arg != 0 &*& dllist(arg);
ensures dllist(arg);
@*/
void reverse(dllist arg)
{
    node ptr = arg->head;
    node temp1 = 0;
    node temp2 = 0;
    
    /*@
    while(ptr != 0)
    invariant nodes(ptr);
    @*/
    while (ptr != 0) 
    {
        temp1 = ptr->next;
        temp2 = ptr->prev;
        ptr->next = temp2;
        ptr->prev = temp1;
        ptr = temp1;
    }
    temp1 = arg->head;
    temp2 = arg->tail;
    arg->head = temp2;
    arg->tail = temp1;
}

/***
 * Description:
The default main function, doing nothing.
*/
int main()
{
    return 0;
}
```

In this revised version of the code:

1. **Predicate Definition**:
   - `nodes(node n)`: This predicate defines the requirement for a linked list, ensuring safety over the structure and its nodes.
   - `dllist(dllist l)`: This predicate defines a doubly linked list, ensuring that the head and tail are set properly.

2. **Precondition and Postcondition**:
   - The precondition `requires` ensures that `arg` is non-null and a valid doubly linked list.
   - The postcondition `ensures` guarantees the list remains valid after reversal.

3. **Loop Invariant**:
   - A loop invariant `while(ptr != 0)` is defined to maintain integrity over the traversal, using the `nodes` predicate that maintains integrity over node links.

VeriFast uses these specifications to perform static verification checks on the code, ensuring specific properties and correctness are upheld throughout the program.
