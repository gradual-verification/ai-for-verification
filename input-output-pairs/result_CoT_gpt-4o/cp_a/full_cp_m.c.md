Sure, here is the annotated C code with formal verification conditions for use with VeriFast. I've added preconditions, postconditions, and loop invariants to ensure memory safety and correctness:

```c
#include "stdlib.h"
#include "stdio.h"
#include <stdbool.h>
#include "assert.h"

//@ predicate valid_pointer(void* p;) = p != 0;

/*@ 
predicate file_open(struct file* f;) = true; // Assumption for opened files
fixpoint bool valid_main_args(int argc, char** argv) { 
    return 0 <= argc && 
           [_]argv(argv, argc, _) && 
           argc >= 3; 
}
@*/

int main(int argc, char** argv) //@ : main
//@ requires valid_main_args(argc, argv);
//@ ensures true;
{
    struct file* from = 0;
    struct file* to = 0;
    char* buffer = 0; 
    int nb_read = 0;
    
    if(argc < 3) { 
        puts("Not enough parameters."); 
        return -1; 
    }
    
    from = fopen(argv[1], "r");
    to = fopen(argv[2], "w");
    buffer = malloc(100);
    
    // Check if resources were allocated correctly
    if(buffer == 0 || from == 0 || to == 0) { 
        abort(); 
    }
    
    //@ open valid_pointer(buffer);
    //@ open file_open(from);
    //@ open file_open(to);
    
    nb_read = fread(buffer, 1, 100, from);
    
    while(0 < nb_read)
    //@ invariant valid_pointer(buffer) &*& 0 <= nb_read <= 100 &*& file_open(to) &*& file_open(from);
    {
        int nb_written = fwrite(buffer, 1, (uintptr_t) nb_read, to);
        
        /*@ 
        // Memory safety check and successful write assumption
        assert 0 <= nb_written <= nb_read; 
        @*/

        nb_read = fread(buffer, 1, 100, from);
        
        /*@ 
        // Update loop invariant based on subsequent read
        assert 0 <= nb_read <= 100; 
        @*/
    }

    // Closing files and freeing memory
    fclose(from);
    fclose(to);
    free(buffer);
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precondition and Postcondition**:
   - Defined a predicate `valid_pointer` to ensure non-null pointers.
   - Added a predicate for the file being "open" as an assumption (`file_open`) since direct file access verification isn't typically within VeriFast's capabilities.
   - `valid_main_args` ensures the correct number of arguments and a valid argument pointer.

2. **Loop Invariant**:
   - Verified that the loop conditions ensure `nb_read` remains within the buffer size limits.
   - Ensures `buffer` remains valid and pointers are correctly handled.

3. **Resource Allocation and Verification**:
   - Used `open` and invariants to represent assumptions about resources like dynamically allocated memory and files being opened/closed correctly.
   - Following best practices for memory safety, the check for successful allocation and graceful abort on failure is in place.

This code reflects a simplified view of resource management and functional behavior verification using VeriFast.
