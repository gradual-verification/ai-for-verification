### Notes for Verification:
1. **Preconditions and Postconditions**: Each function is given a precondition and a postcondition using predicates to ensure the valid range of `enum day`.

2. **Loop Invariants**: There are no loops in this code, so no invariants are necessary.

3. **Memory Safety and Integer Bounds**: Memory safety is checked by ensuring that the variables are being used within their expected range; an unexpected assignment like `d = 35` demonstrates incorrect usage not compliant with our predicate constraints.

4. **Open/Close specifications**: Used around predicates to specify when those logical constraints need to be considered in the verification flow.

By running this code through VeriFast, we assure that all specified conditions are verified, enforcing the functional correctness and memory safety stipulated in the conditions.
