To verify the provided C code with Verifast, we will add formal specifications in the form of preconditions, postconditions, and loop invariants if necessary. In this specific code, we'll be focusing on memory safety and integer bounds as described in the steps. Here is the modified code with Verifast specifications included:

```c
enum day { monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday, saturday, sunday };

enum large_numbers { large_number = 30000, another_large_number, yaln = -0x7fff - 1};

enum day next_day(enum day d)
//@ requires 0 <= d && d < 7;  // The input day is within valid bounds (enum day range).
//@ ensures 0 <= result && result < 7;  // Resulting day is also within valid bounds (enum day range).
{
    return (d + 1) % 7;  // Logic to get the next day in the week.
}

int main() //@ : main
//@ requires true;  // No preconditions, as this is the entry point for the program.
//@ ensures true;  // No postcondition other than termination assurance.
{
    enum day d = monday;
    d = 35;  // This assignment goes against our safe bound assumption on 'd', it's illustrative for verification.
    int x = d;

    // Ensure the static assertions hold
    assert(large_number == 30000);  // Asserting the constant value for large_number.
    assert(another_large_number == 30001);  // Slight increment check on the previous large number.
    assert(yaln + 1 == -0x7fff);  // Border case for negative max range establishment.
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the additions to the code:

1. **Preconditions and Postconditions**:
   - For `next_day`, these have been established to ensure that the function only operates within the bounds of the `enum day` type, and that it returns a valid `enum day`.

2. **Assertions in `main()`**:
   - The static assertions check that the enumerated values behave as expected. This is especially crucial to validate assumptions about constant values.

3. **Loop Invariants and Other Specifications**:
   - There are no loops in the given program, hence no loop invariants are necessary.
   - No additional auxiliary specifications like `open`, `close`, or lemma applications are necessary as the logic here is straightforward.

Following these steps ensures that the code is formally verified with basic safety and boundary checks using Verifast for the `next_day` function. The existing main function doesn't fully adhere to safe assignments, such as `d = 35`, which cannot be safely checked with Verifast given the `enum`'s bounds in the verification.
