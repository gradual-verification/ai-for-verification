To verify the C code using VeriFast, we need to add specifications in the form of preconditions, postconditions, predicates, and possibly loop invariants. However, in the given code, there are no loops, so we will focus on preconditions, postconditions, and necessary statements to interact with VeriFast's verification logic.

```c
#include "stdlib.h"

/* Declare a predicate for managing the structure's memory */
predicate counter(struct counter *c, int f) = 
    c->f |-> f;

/* Declare a predicate for managing the global pointer memory */
predicate counter_global(struct counter *c) = 
  c != 0 &*& malloc_block_counter(c) &*& counter(c, ?f);

/* Declare a predicate for managing the global variable x */
predicate x_global() = 
  &x |-> ?v;

/*  
 * Given that:
 *  - We have a global integer `x`.
 *  - We have a global pointer `c` referencing a `struct counter`.
 * Precondition and postcondition for m()
 */
/*@
requires x_global() &*& counter_global(c);
ensures x_global() &*& counter(c, ?new_f) &*& new_f == old_f + 1;
@*/
void m()
//@ requires x_global() &*& counter(c, ?old_f);
//@ ensures x_global() &*& counter(c, old_f + 1);
{
    int y = x;
    x = y + 1;
    c->f = c->f + 1;
}

/*
 * Entry point of the program.
 * Precondition and postcondition for main()
 */
/*@
requires true;
ensures true;
@*/
int main()
//@ requires true;
//@ ensures true;
{
    x = 7;
    //@ close x_global();
    struct counter *ctr = malloc(sizeof(struct counter));
    if (ctr == 0) abort();
    //@ close malloc_block_counter(ctr);
    ctr->f = 42;
    //@ close counter(ctr, 42);
    c = ctr;
    //@ close counter_global(c);
    
    m();
    // Obtain the updated f value
    //@ open counter_global(c);
    int ctr_f = ctr->f;
    assert(ctr_f == 43);
    //@ leak malloc_block_counter(c);
    //@ leak counter(c, _);
    free(ctr);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Predicates:**
   - `counter(struct counter *c, int f)`: Represents the memory state of the `struct counter` with contents of `f`.
   - `counter_global(struct counter *c)`: Represents the state when a global pointer `c` points to a valid `struct counter`.
   - `x_global()`: Represents the memory state of the global variable `x`.

2. **Preconditions and Postconditions:**
   - `m()`: 
     - Requires that `x_global()` and `counter` predicates are available.
     - Ensures that `counter` predicate's `f` is incremented by 1.
   - `main()`:
     - Uses default placeholders as the primary goal is to ensure global states are appropriately manipulated and cleaned.

3. **In main():** 
   - Wraps memory allocations and writes with `close` and `open` statements to handle predicates.
   - Ensures memory safety with checks before dereferencing pointers.

4. **Memory Management:**
   - Uses `malloc_block_counter` predicate to handle memory allocation declarations and eventual leaks.
  
This specification aims to verify the code logic that updates the global variable and struct's field correctly, while addressing memory constraints and ensuring safety using VeriFast.
