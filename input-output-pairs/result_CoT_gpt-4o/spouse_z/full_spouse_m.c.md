Here's the provided C code with formal verification annotations using VeriFast. I've structured the annotations to ensure memory safety and adherence to the specified preconditions and postconditions:

```c
#include "stdlib.h"

struct person {
    char* name;
    struct person* spouse;
};

/*@
predicate person(struct person *p, struct person *spouse) =
    p != 0 &*& p->name |-> _ &*& (spouse == 0 ? p->spouse |-> 0 : p != spouse
    &*& [1/2] p->spouse |-> spouse &*& [1/2] spouse->spouse |-> p) &*&  malloc_block_person(p);
@*/

struct person *create_person()
//@ requires true;
//@ ensures person(result, 0) &*& result != 0;
{
    struct person *p = malloc(sizeof(struct person));
    if(p == 0) abort();
    p->spouse = 0;
    return p;
}

void marry(struct person *this, struct person *other)
//@ requires person(this, 0) &*& person(other, 0);
//@ ensures person(this, other) &*& person(other, this);
{
    this->spouse = other;
    other->spouse = this;
}

struct person* person_get_spouse(struct person* this)
//@ requires person(this, ?spouse);
//@ ensures person(this, spouse) &*& result == spouse;
{
    return this->spouse;
}

void divorce(struct person* this)
//@ requires person(this, ?other) &*& person(other, this);
//@ ensures person(this, 0) &*& person(other, 0);
{
    this->spouse->spouse = 0;
    //@ open person(this, other);
    //@ open person(other, this);
    this->spouse = 0;
    //@ close person(this, 0);
    //@ close person(other, 0);
}

void die(struct person *this)
//@ requires person(this, ?other) &*& (other == 0 ? true : person(other, this));
//@ ensures other == 0 ? true : person(other, 0);
{
    if(this->spouse != 0) {
        //@ open person(this, other);
        this->spouse->spouse = 0;
        //@ close person(other, 0);
    }
    //@ open person(this, other);
    free(this); 
}

int main() //@ : main
//@ requires true;
//@ ensures true;
{
    struct person* alice = create_person();
    struct person* bob = create_person();
    struct person* eve = 0;
    
    marry(alice, bob);
    eve = create_person();
    divorce(bob);
    marry(bob, eve);
    die(alice);
    die(bob);
    die(eve);
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Predicates and Preconditions/Postconditions**: Each function has been annotated with preconditions and postconditions. For instance, `create_person` ensures that the result is a valid person struct initialized with no spouse. Functions like `marry`, `divorce`, and `die` manipulate the `spouse` references and ensure the changes maintain the integrity of the data structure.

- **Opening and Closing Predicates**: Whenever a function accesses or modifies shared mutable state, we open the predicate (using `open`) before accessing it and close it (using `close`) after modifying it to reflect the changes and verify the logic transition according to the preconditions and postconditions.

- **Memory Management**: Goals related to memory, like ensuring the result of `malloc` is not null and freeing memory when no longer needed, are enforced through proper use of predicates and ensuring that all paths maintain these constraints.

These annotations and VeriFast-specific keywords (e.g., `require`, `ensure`, `open`, `close`) help VeriFast verify the correctness and safety of the C code according to the specified functional behavior.
