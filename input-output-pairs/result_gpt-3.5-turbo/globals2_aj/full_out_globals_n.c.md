/** 
 * Description:
The main function serves as the entry point of the program and carries out various tasks including memory allocation, initialization, function calling, and validation.

 * Specification:
The main function initializes the global variable x to 7, allocates memory for a global structure counter, sets the value of its field f to 42, assigns the structure to global pointer c, calls the m function, and validates that the field f has been updated correctly.

The postcondition of the main function checks that the field f of the structure has been incremented by 1, confirming that the m function has updated the structure correctly. Afterwards, the allocated memory is freed.

@return
0 upon successful completion.
