To verify the C code with VeriFast, we need to define the necessary predicates and ensure the specifications in the code align with these definitions. Here's how you can modify the code to include proper formal verification:

```c
#include "stdlib.h"

// Define a predicate for the account balance
//@ predicate account_balance(struct account *a, int b) = a->balance |-> b;

struct account {
    int balance;
};

struct account *create_account()
//@ requires true;
//@ ensures account_balance(result, 0) &*& malloc_block_account(result);
{
    struct account *myAccount = malloc(sizeof(struct account));
    if (myAccount == 0)
    {
        abort();
    }
    myAccount->balance = 0;
    //@ close account_balance(myAccount, 0);
    return myAccount;
}

void account_set_balance(struct account *myAccount, int newBalance)
//@ requires account_balance(myAccount, _);
//@ ensures account_balance(myAccount, newBalance);
{
    //@ open account_balance(myAccount, _);
    myAccount->balance = newBalance;
    //@ close account_balance(myAccount, newBalance);
}

void account_dispose(struct account *myAccount)
//@ requires account_balance(myAccount, _) &*& malloc_block_account(myAccount);
//@ ensures true;
{
    //@ open account_balance(myAccount, _);
    free(myAccount);
}

int main()
//@ requires true;
//@ ensures true;
{
    struct account *myAccount = create_account();
    account_set_balance(myAccount, 5);
    account_dispose(myAccount);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Modifications:

1. **Predicate Definition**: We define a predicate `account_balance` which captures the idea that a given `struct account` pointer `a` has a certain balance `b`.

2. **Logic in Functions**:
   - **`create_account`**: After allocating memory for `myAccount`, we use `close` to establish the `account_balance` predicate at the initial balance value of 0.
   - **`account_set_balance`**: We use `open` to consume the existing `account_balance` predicate, allowing us to modify the balance, then `close` to reestablish the predicate with the updated balance value.
   - **`account_dispose`**: Before freeing the memory, we `open` the `account_balance` to ensure we no longer need any logical information attached to `myAccount`.

The modifications ensure that each function's pre- and post-conditions align with what VeriFast expects according to the logical state of the program.
