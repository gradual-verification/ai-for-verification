To incorporate formal verification in the provided C code using VeriFast, we need to define and use predicates to specify and verify the properties we want to ensure about our program. Here is the modified code, complete with specifications and definitions necessary for VeriFast verification:

```c
#include "stdlib.h"

// Predicate definition for account_balance
//@ predicate account_balance(struct account *a, int b) = a->balance |-> b;

struct account
{
    int balance;
};

struct account *create_account()
//@ requires true;
//@ ensures account_balance(result, 0);
{
    struct account *myAccount = malloc(sizeof(struct account));
    if (myAccount == 0)
    {
        abort();
    }
    myAccount->balance = 0;
    //@ close account_balance(myAccount, 0);
    return myAccount;
}

void account_set_balance(struct account *myAccount, int newBalance)
//@ requires account_balance(myAccount, _);
//@ ensures account_balance(myAccount, newBalance);
{
    //@ open account_balance(myAccount, _);
    myAccount->balance = newBalance;
    //@ close account_balance(myAccount, newBalance);
}

void account_dispose(struct account *myAccount)
//@ requires account_balance(myAccount, _);
//@ ensures true;
{
    //@ open account_balance(myAccount, _);
    free(myAccount);
}

int main()
//@ requires true;
//@ ensures true;
{
    struct account *myAccount = create_account();
    account_set_balance(myAccount, 5);
    account_dispose(myAccount);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Predicate Definition**: 
   - Added a predicate `account_balance` to describe the state of an account object. It states that if we have `account_balance(a, b)`, the `balance` field of structure `a` points to integer `b`.
   - `account_balance` connects the logical state (the balance) with the physical state (the memory location).

2. **Function Specifications**: 
   - Each function that manipulates the balance of an account now requires and ensures predicates that describe what it expects when it is called and what it ensures when it finishes.
   - Use `open` and `close` to access and seal the predicate around manipulations of the `balance`.

3. **Memory Management**:
   - The specification accurately reflects the need to ensure that memory is properly allocated and deallocated, with predicates used to reflect ownership and use of memory.
   
These changes will allow the VeriFast tool to check the function's implementation against its specification and ensure that they adhere to the contract implied by the predicates.
