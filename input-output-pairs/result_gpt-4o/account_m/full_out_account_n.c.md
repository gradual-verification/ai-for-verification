To integrate formal verification using VeriFast for the provided C code, we must add contracts in the form of annotations (preconditions and postconditions) to specify and verify the behavior of each function. Below is the modified code with these specifications.

```c
#include "stdlib.h"
/*@
predicate account(struct account* a; int b) = 
    a != 0 &*& a->balance |-> b;
@*/

struct account
{
    int balance;
};

/***
 * Description:
The create_account function creates a new account by dynamically allocating
memory for a struct account object.

@param none

The function initializes the balance of the account to zero. If the memory allocation
fails, the function aborts. It finally returns a pointer to the newly created account.
*/

/*@
requires true;
ensures result != 0 &*& account(result, 0);
@*/
struct account *create_account()
{
    struct account *myAccount = malloc(sizeof(struct account));
    if (myAccount == 0)
    {
        abort();
    }
    //@ close account(myAccount, 0);
    return myAccount;
}

/***
 * Description:
The account_set_balance function updates the balance of the given account
to the specified new balance.

@param myAccount - the account to be updated.
@param newBalance - the new balance to be set.

The function modifies the balance of the passed account to the
new balance value provided.
*/

/*@
requires account(myAccount, _);
ensures account(myAccount, newBalance);
@*/
void account_set_balance(struct account *myAccount, int newBalance)
{
    myAccount->balance = newBalance;
}

/***
 * Description:
The account_dispose function frees the memory allocated for the given account.

@param myAccount - the account to be deleted.

The function frees the memory allocated for the existing account.
*/

/*@
requires account(myAccount, _);
ensures true;
@*/
void account_dispose(struct account *myAccount)
{
    //@ open account(myAccount, _);
    free(myAccount);
}

/***
 * Description:
The main function first creates an account, then sets its balance and finally disposes that account.
*/

/*@
requires true;
ensures true;
@*/
int main()
{
    struct account *myAccount = create_account();
    account_set_balance(myAccount, 5);
    account_dispose(myAccount);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Predicate Declaration**: A predicate `account` is declared to capture the state of an account object. It is specified with `a->balance |-> b`, which represents the logical field access within VeriFast's annotation syntax.

2. **Function Contracts**: Each function is annotated with preconditions (`requires`) and postconditions (`ensures`):

   - `create_account`: Assumes no preconditions since it is generally safe to call and ensures that the returned account has an initial balance of zero.
   - `account_set_balance`: Requires the `account` predicate as precondition and ensures the updated balance is correctly applied.
   - `account_dispose`: Requires the `account` predicate as precondition because it expects a valid structure to free. After freeing, it ensures no obligations are outstanding.

3. **Annotations in Function Bodies**: Inside function bodies:
   - `@ close account(...)` is used to establish the predicate after memory allocation and initialization.
   - `@ open account(...)` is used to consume the predicate before deallocating the structure to respect the predicate abstraction.

This setup helps VeriFast verify memory safety, proper resource management, and consistency with specified behavior.
