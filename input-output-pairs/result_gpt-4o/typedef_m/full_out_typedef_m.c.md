Certainly! Here is the C code, complete with VeriFast annotations to formally verify the logic, especially focusing on `my_int` usage and the assertion:

```c
typedef int my_int;

int main()
//@ requires true;
//@ ensures true;
{
    my_int x = 5;
    int y = x;
    my_int z = 3;
    my_int t = x + z;
    //@ assert t == 8;
    return 0;
}
```

The code correctly ensures that the operation involving the typedef `my_int` is properly verified. The assertion `t == 8` is explicitly included as a VeriFast assertion to be checked during verification.
