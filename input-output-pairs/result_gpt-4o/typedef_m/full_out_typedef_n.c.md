To verify the C code using Verifast, we need to include the correct annotations and specifications. Below is the modified code block suitable for verification by Verifast:

```c
#include <assert.h>
// Verifast requires the <assert.h> header for assertions

typedef int my_int;

/*@ 
  requires true;
  ensures result == 0;
@*/
int main()
{
    // Declare a variable 'x' of type 'my_int' and initialize it to 5
    my_int x = 5;
    
    // Declare a variable 'y' of type 'int' and assign the value of 'x'
    int y = x;
    
    // Declare a variable 'z' of type 'my_int' and assign it the value 3
    my_int z = 3;
    
    // Declare a variable 't' of type 'my_int' and assign it the sum of 'x' and 'z'
    my_int t = x + z;
    
    // Assertion to ensure 't' is equal to 8
    assert(t == 8);
    
    // Return 0
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Annotations**: To verify with Verifast, you should annotate the code with preconditions (`requires`) and postconditions (`ensures`). In this case, there are no specific requirements on the inputs, so we simply state `requires true;`. The `ensures result == 0;` states that the function will terminate with a return value of 0.

2. **Assertions**: The `assert(t == 8);` is supported by Verifast to confirm that logical conditions hold true during execution.

3. **Verification**: With the annotations, Verifast should be able to correctly verify this program, confirming that the assertion `t == 8` holds and that the function correctly returns 0.
