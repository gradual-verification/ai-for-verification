To perform formal verification with VeriFast, the specifications need to closely describe the behavior and adhere to the required logic certain functions. In this case, we will ensure the loop invariant is specified correctly, which is crucial for the verification of the loop in the `sum_of_range` function. The loop invariant maintains a consistent state about the loop during each iteration. Here's the modified code with specifications that should be verified by VeriFast:

```c
/*@ 
fixpoint_auto list<int> range(int min, int max) 
    decreases max - min; 
{ 
    return min == max ? nil : cons(min, range(min + 1, max)); 
}

fixpoint int sum(list<int> xs) { 
    switch (xs) { 
        case nil: return 0; 
        case cons(x0, xs0): return x0 + sum(xs0); 
    } 
}
@*/

int sum_of_range(int n)
//@ requires 0 <= n;
//@ ensures result == sum(range(0, n));
{
    int count = 0;
    int sum = 0;
    //@ list<int> values = range(0, n);
    //@ close foreach(values, true);
    //@ close foreach_take(0, values, true);
    while (count != n)
    //@ invariant 0 <= count <= n &*& sum == sum(take(count, values));
    {
        sum = sum + count;
        count = count + 1;
        //@ open foreach(_, _);
    }
    //@ open foreach(_, _);
    return sum;
}

int main()
//@ requires true;
//@ ensures true;
{
    return 0;
}
```

In this version, the loop invariant has been added to express the current state inside the loop. It indicates that at each iteration:

- The current `count` is within the range `[0, n]`.
- The variable `sum` corresponds to the sum of the first `count` elements of the list `range(0, n)`. 

These invariants and the usage of the `forearch` predicate family help VeriFast reason about the loop's correctness and ensure the final result's accordance with the specified postcondition.
