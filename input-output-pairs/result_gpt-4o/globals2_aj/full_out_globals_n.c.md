To formally verify the code using VeriFast, we need to add appropriate preconditions, postconditions, and invariants to ensure that the logic of the functions is properly specified and verified. Here's how we can modify the given C code:

```c
#include "stdlib.h"
/*@
predicate counter(struct counter *c, int f) =
    c != 0 &*& c->f |-> f;
@*/

static int x;
static struct counter *c;

struct counter {
    int f;
};

/*@
requires true;
ensures x == old_x + 1 &*& counter(c, old_f + 1) &*& old_x == *x &*& old_f == *f;
@*/
void m()
//@ requires counter(c, ?old_f) &*& c != 0;
//@ ensures counter(c, old_f + 1) &*& x == old_x + 1;
{
    int y = x;
    x = y + 1;
    c->f = c->f + 1;
}

/*@
requires true;
ensures result == 0;
@*/
int main()
//@ requires true;
//@ ensures true;
{
    x = 7;
    struct counter *ctr = malloc(sizeof(struct counter));
    if (ctr == 0) abort();
    //@ open malloc_block(ctr);
    ctr->f = 42;
    //@ close counter(ctr, 42);
    c = ctr;
    m();
    int ctr_f = ctr->f;
    assert(ctr_f == 43);
    //@ open counter(ctr, 43);
    free(ctr);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Predicate Definition**: We defined a predicate `counter` that describes the state of the `struct counter` to ensure we have proper ownership over `f` and it is initialized.

2. **Specifications for `m` Function**:
   - We added the specifications using `/*@ requires ... ensures ... @*/` to specify that `m` requires the predicate `counter(c, old_f)` and updates the `x` and `f` values correctly.

3. **Main Function**:
   - We added formal specifications using the same syntax for the `main` function.
   - We specify the precondition (`requires`) and postcondition (`ensures`) ensuring the allocation and deallocation of memory are handled carefully.

4. **Memory Operations**:
   - We include the necessary adjustments in entries like `open` and `close` of predicates related to heap memory operations.

Note: This code is intended to illustrate how formal verification could be added. The actual verification would require running this code through a tool like VeriFast to ensure its correctness.
