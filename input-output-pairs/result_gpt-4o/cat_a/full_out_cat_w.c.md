To verify the provided C code using VeriFast, we need to add appropriate annotations and this involves specifying the contracts and properties that the code must satisfy. Here is an example of how you'd modify the code to be properly annotated for verification with VeriFast:

```c
#include "stdio.h"
#include "malloc.h"
#include "stdlib.h"

int main(int argc, char** argv) //@ : main
//@ requires 0 <= argc &*& [_]argv(argv, argc, _);
//@ ensures true;
{
  FILE* fp = 0; 
  char* buffer = 0; 
  char* res = 0;
  
  if(argc < 2) { 
    puts("Enter a file name."); 
    return -1; 
  }
  
  fp = fopen(argv[1], "r");
  //@ assert fp == 0 || fp != 0; // file pointer can either be null or valid
  
  buffer = malloc(sizeof(char) * 100);
  //@ assert buffer == 0 || buffer != 0; // buffer can either be null or valid
  
  res = 0;
  
  if(fp == 0 || buffer == 0) { 
    abort(); 
  }
  
  res = fgets(buffer, 100, fp);
  
  while(res != 0) 
  {
    puts(buffer);
    res = fgets(buffer, 100, fp);
  }
  
  free(buffer);
  fclose(fp);
  
  return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Annotations:
- **`main:`** A function marked with `//@ : main` indicates a special entry point for VeriFast.
- **`requires 0 <= argc &*& [_]argv(argv, argc, _);`**: This precondition asserts that `argc` is non-negative. The `_` behind the `argv` in the annotation indicates that our program does not modify `argv`.
- **`ensures true;`**: A postcondition always true; the program always terminates without assertion violation or undefined behavior post verification.
- **`assert`** statements are used within the code to assert that certain conditions hold just before or after a line, particularly to check if a pointer is NULL which could lead to undefined behavior if used improperly.

### Important Notes:
While we've made the annotations here to align with logical correctness checks, in an actual application you would also need to reason about the correctness of the logic itself like ensuring that errors from library functions (`fopen`, `malloc`) are handled properly, and that the application behave as expected.
