Verifying C programs with VeriFast involves annotating the code with preconditions, postconditions, and other specifications. In your context, verifying that file and memory operations succeed is key. Here's how you can provide specifications to the C code to facilitate verification by VeriFast.

```c
#include "stdio.h"
#include "stdlib.h"

//@ #include "nat.gh"

// VeriFast annotations include:
// `requires` that specifies the preconditions
// `ensures` that specifies the postconditions

int main(int argc, char** argv) //@ : main
//@ requires argc >= 2 &*& argv(argv, argc, _); // Partial knowledge about argv
//@ ensures true;
{
    FILE* fp = NULL; 
    char* buffer = NULL; 
    char* res = NULL;

    if (argc < 2) { 
        puts("Enter a file name."); 
        return -1; 
    }
    
    fp = fopen(argv[1], "r");
    buffer = malloc(sizeof(char) * 100);
    res = NULL;

    if (fp == NULL || buffer == NULL) { 
        if (buffer != NULL) free(buffer);
        if (fp != NULL) fclose(fp);
        abort(); 
    }
    
    //@ close exists<int>(100);
    res = fgets(buffer, 100, fp);

    while (res != NULL) 
    //@ invariant buffer != NULL;
    {
        puts(buffer);
        res = fgets(buffer, 100, fp);
    }

    free(buffer);
    fclose(fp);
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Preconditions and Postconditions:**
   - The precondition `requires argc >= 2 &*& argv(argv, argc, _);` states that the `argc` must be at least 2 (indicating a valid filename argument is passed).
   - The `ensures true;` condition ensures that the function returns without maintaining further obligations.

2. **Resource Management:**
   - Before aborting, it's crucial to ensure any allocation is properly deallocated to avoid resource leaks, hence the checks `if (buffer != NULL) free(buffer);` and `if (fp != NULL) fclose(fp);` before `abort();`.

3. **Invariants:**
   - An invariant inside the `while` loop guarantees the consistent state of buffer during each iteration.

The specifications provided here are simple but sufficient for basic static verification tasks. Additional checks would be necessary for more complex properties, especially if the code included more complex operations or threading.
