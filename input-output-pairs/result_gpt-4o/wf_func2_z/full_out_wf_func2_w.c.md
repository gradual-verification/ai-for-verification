To verify the provided C code with VeriFast, you need to formally specify the program behavior using annotations that describe the expected state of the memory before and after execution. The annotations are written as specifications using preconditions and postconditions. Here, we'll ensure that the use of the buffer corresponds to its representation as a sequence of identical characters. 

```c
#include <stddef.h>

/*@
fixpoint_auto list<t> n_times<t>(t x, int count) {
    return count == 0 ? nil : cons(x, n_times(x, count - 1));
}
@*/

void fill(char *buf, int length, char c)
//@ requires chars(buf, length, _);
//@ ensures chars(buf, length, n_times(c, length));
{
    for (int i = 0; i < length; i++)
    //@ invariant chars(buf, length, append(n_times(c, i), ?rest));
    {
        buf[i] = c;
        //@ close chars(buf + i, 1, n_times(c, 1));
        //@ append_assoc(n_times(c, i), n_times(c, 1), rest);
    }
}

int main()
//@ requires true;
//@ ensures true;
{
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Annotations and Invariants**: 
  - We use `chars(buf, length, _)` to describe initially that the buffer `buf` has unspecified contents (indicated by `_`) of length `length`.
  - In the loop, we establish a loop invariant that indicates the current state of the buffer: `append(n_times(c, i), ?rest)`. This represents that the first `i` characters are filled with `c`, and `rest` denotes the uninitialized tail.
  - When a character at a particular index is set to `c`, the post-state is updated, and the invariant is maintained.

- **Verification Logic**:
  - The precondition (`requires`) ensures that `buf` is a valid array of a given length.
  - The postcondition (`ensures`) confirms that after execution, `buf` is filled with `c` repeated `length` times.
  - The loop invariant captures the state of the array within the loop, growing the initialized portion and shrinking the uninitialized (or irrelevant) portion.

These specifications and invariants guide VeriFast in verifying the correctness of the `fill` function. Adjusting the loop invariant and control over the buffer allows the verifier to validate the transformation of the buffer's state correctly.
