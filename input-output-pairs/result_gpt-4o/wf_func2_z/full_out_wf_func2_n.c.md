To verify the `fill` function with VeriFast, we need to use formal specifications, typically expressed in separation logic, to describe the required preconditions and postconditions for the function. Below is the code with added specifications suitable for verification with VeriFast.

```c
#include <stddef.h>

// Verifast annotations for ghost variables and predicate definitions

// Helper predicate that describes an array segment
predicate char_array(char *arr, int len;) =
  len == 0 ? emp : character(arr, _) &*& char_array(arr + 1, len - 1);

// Fill function specification and implementation
/**
 * Requires:
 * - `buf` points to a valid memory segment of at least `length` elements.
 * Ensures:
 * - All elements in the `buf` array from 0 to `length - 1` are set to `c`.
 * 
 * @requires length >= 0 && char_array(buf, length)
 * @ensures char_array(buf, length) &*& forall{i: int | 0 <= i && i < length}(buf[i] == c)
 */
void fill(char *buf, int length, char c)
    //@ requires length >= 0 &*& char_array(buf, length);
    //@ ensures char_array(buf, length) &*& forall(int i; 0 <= i && i < length)(buf[i] == c);
{
    for (int i = 0; i < length; i++)
        //@ invariant 0 <= i &*& i <= length &*& char_array(buf, length) &*& forall(int j; 0 <= j && j < i)(buf[j] == c);
    {
        buf[i] = c;
        //@ close char_array(buf + i, length - i - 1);
    }
}

int main()
    //@ requires true;
    //@ ensures true;
{
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
- **Predicates:** `char_array` is a helper predicate to denote that `buf` points to an array of characters of a specified length in memory.
- **Precondition (`requires`):** Specifies that `buf` is a valid memory area that can hold at least `length` characters.
- **Postcondition (`ensures`):** Specifies that after the function executes, every element in the array `buf` has been set to the character `c`. The `forall` quantifier is used to assert this condition for the range `[0, length)`.
- **Loop Invariant:** Maintains that at the start of each loop iteration, `buf` contains `c` from the start up to the current index `i`. The invariant ensures memory safety and array bounds are respected.

These specifications help VeriFast verify that the `fill` function behaves as expected concerning memory safety and functional correctness.
