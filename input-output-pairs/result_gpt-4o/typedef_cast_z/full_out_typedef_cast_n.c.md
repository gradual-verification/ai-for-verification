### Explanation:

In the above code, we have added VeriFast annotations to specify the preconditions and postconditions for the `foo` function and the `main` function.

- `requires x >= INT16_MIN && x <= INT16_MAX;` and `requires y >= INT16_MIN && y <= INT16_MAX;` specify that the input parameters `x` and `y` must be within the range of a 16-bit signed integer.
- `ensures true;` specifies that the function guarantees to terminate correctly, but makes no other claims about the state of the program after execution. Since `foo` is meant to demonstrate type casting and does not have a further contract, this is sufficient.

The use of annotations helps ensure that type conversions do not result in undefined behavior or overflow issues. These contracts enable VeriFast to verify that the program adheres to these specifications, ensuring correctness regarding these conditions.
