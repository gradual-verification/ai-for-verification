To formally verify the provided code using VeriFast, we need to add appropriate specifications and annotations. VeriFast requires careful handling of memory and pointer operations, and specifications to ensure correctness. Below is the modified code block with necessary annotations and specifications:

```c
#include "stdlib.h"
//@ #include "quantifiers.gh"

/*@
predicate point(struct point *p; int x, int y) =
    struct_point_x(p, ?px) &*&
    struct_point_y(p, ?py) &*&
    px == x &*&
    py == y;
@*/

/***
 * Description:
 * The swap function takes two integer pointers as parameters and swaps the values they point to.
 *
 * @param a - Pointer to the first integer value to be swapped.
 * @param b - Pointer to the second integer value to be swapped.
 */
/*@
requires integer(a, ?va) &*& integer(b, ?vb);
ensures integer(a, vb) &*& integer(b, va);
@*/
void swap(int *a, int *b) 
{
    int tmp = *a;
    *a = *b;
    *b = tmp;
}

struct point {
    int x;
    int y;
};

/***
 * Description:
 * The point_mirror function takes a pointer to a struct point as a parameter and swaps the x and y values of the point.
 *
 * @param p - Pointer to the struct point whose x and y values need to be swapped.
 */
/*@
requires point(p, ?x, ?y);
ensures point(p, y, x);
@*/
void point_mirror(struct point *p)
{
    //@ open point(p, x, y);
    swap(&p->x, &p->y);
    //@ close point(p, y, x);
}

/***
 * Description: 
 * The main function of the program that allocates memory for a struct point, initializes its x and y values, 
 * mirrors the point, checks if the mirror operation was successful, and frees the allocated memory before exiting.
 */
/*@
requires true;
ensures true;
@*/
int main()
{
    struct point *p = malloc(sizeof(struct point));
    if (p == 0) { abort(); }
    //@ close point(p, 3, 10);
    p->x = 3;
    p->y = 10;
    point_mirror(p);
    //@ open point(p, 10, 3);
    bool b = p->x == 10 && p->y == 3;
    assert(b);
    free(p);
    return 0;
}
```

In this version:

- We define a predicate `point` to represent the memory layout of the `struct point`.
- We specify preconditions and postconditions for the `swap` and `point_mirror` functions using VeriFast annotations (`//@`).
- In `swap`, we specify that the integers pointed to by `a` and `b` are swapped. We use the `integer` predicate provided by VeriFast.
- In `point_mirror`, we express that the x and y coordinates of the point are swapped.
- Memory allocation, deallocation, and manipulation are carefully annotated to ensure that allocated resources are properly managed.

This annotated version of the code should verify successfully with VeriFast.
