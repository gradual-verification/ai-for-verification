To formally verify the given C code using VeriFast, we need to include specifications for the function and invariants for the loop. This involves defining preconditions and postconditions for the function, as well as loop invariants that hold true during each iteration of the loop. Here's how you can add these specifications and verify them with VeriFast:

```c
#include "stdlib.h"

/*@
predicate nodes(node n, node p, dllist l) =
  n == 0 ? (p == l->tail) : 
  (n->prev |-> p &*& n->next |-> ?nn &*& 
  nodes(nn, n, l));

predicate dllist(dllist l) =
  l->head |-> ?head &*& l->tail |-> ?tail &*&
  nodes(head, 0, l);
@*/

/*@
requires dllist(arg);
ensures dllist(arg);
@*/
void reverse(dllist arg)
{
    node ptr = arg->head;
    node temp1 = 0;
    node temp2 = 0;

    /*@
    loop_invariant nodes(ptr, temp2, arg) &*& 
                    (temp2 == 0 ? arg->head == ptr : ptr->prev == temp2) &*&
                    dllist(arg);
    @*/
    while (ptr != 0)
    {
        temp1 = ptr->next;
        temp2 = ptr->prev;
        ptr->next = temp2;
        ptr->prev = temp1;
        ptr = temp1;
    }

    temp1 = arg->head;
    temp2 = arg->tail;
    arg->head = temp2;
    arg->tail = temp1;
}
```

In the code above, the following has been added:

- **Predicate Declaration (`nodes` and `dllist`)**: These predicates describe the structure of a doubly linked list. The predicate `nodes` recursively describes the list's nodes, specifying how each node points to the next and the previous node in the list. The predicate `dllist` ensures that the doubly linked list's head and tail pointers are accounted for the structure.

- **Function Specification**: This includes the `requires` clause, which ensures that the function operates on a valid doubly linked list, and the `ensures` clause, ensuring the list remains valid after the function executes.

- **Loop Invariants**: The loop invariant is crucial for verifying correctness during the loop execution. It ensures that the structure of the list is maintained partially as the pointers are being swapped.

This code block should be placed in a .c file and then verified using VeriFast to ensure correctness under the specified conditions.
