To properly verify the C code using VeriFast, we need to add contracts (preconditions and postconditions) for the functions and specify the resources that are accessed and modified. This includes specifying ownership and ensuring memory is properly managed. Here's the modified code with the necessary specifications in the format compatible with VeriFast:

```c
#include "stdlib.h"

// Global variables
static int x;

// Structure definition
struct counter {
    int f;
};

// Global pointer
static struct counter *c;

/*@
predicate counter(struct counter *ctr, int f) =
    ctr->f |-> f;
@*/

/*@ 
requires x == _ &*& c == _; // c and x can be accessed but are not owned
ensures x == _ &*& c == _;  // c and x can be accessed but are not owned
@*/
void m()
//@ requires [?f1]counter(c, ?f) &*& c != 0;
//@ ensures [f1]counter(c, f + 1);
{
    int y = x;
    x = y + 1;
    c->f = c->f + 1;
}

/*@ 
requires true;
ensures true;
@*/
int main()
//@ requires true;
//@ ensures true;
{
    x = 7;

    struct counter *ctr = malloc(sizeof(struct counter));
    if (ctr == 0) abort();
    //@ close counter(ctr, 42);
    ctr->f = 42;

    c = ctr;
    
    //@ open counter(c, 42);
    m();
    //@ open counter(c, 43);

    int ctr_f = ctr->f;
    //@ assert ctr_f == 43;

    //@ close counter(c, 43);
    free(ctr);

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Predicates:** 
   - A predicate `counter` is defined to capture the ownership of the structure's field `f`.

2. **Function Contracts:**
   - Function `m` is annotated with requires and ensures clauses describing expected preconditions and postconditions in terms of the `counter` predicate.
   - Ownership of `counter` (and correctness of its value) is contractually managed, so `main` and `m` assert correct values.
   
3. **Resource Management:**
   - Use procedures to open and close the predicate to gain or release access to the structure's field `f` before and after calling `m()`.

4. **Assertions:**
   - The assertion `assert ctr_f == 43;` verifies the expected increment of `f` after `m()` is invoked.
