To ensure the code can be correctly verified in VeriFast, we'll add proper specifications and restrictions. Specifically, we'll address the initialization of the `enum day` variable to prevent values outside its defined range and correct the specification to use `enum day` correctly within the given range:

```c
#include <stdbool.h>

enum day { monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday, saturday, sunday };

enum large_numbers { large_number = 30000, another_large_number, yaln = -0x7fff - 1};

enum day next_day(enum day d)
//@ requires day(d);
//@ ensures day(result);
{
    return (d + 1) % 7;
}

bool day(enum day d) 
//@ requires true;
//@ ensures result == (0 <= d && d < 7);
{
    return 0 <= d && d < 7;
}

int main() //@ : main
  //@ requires true;
  //@ ensures true;
{
    enum day d = monday;
    //@ assert day(d);
    
    d = next_day(d);
    //@ assert day(d);

    int x = d;
    //@ assert large_number == 30000;
    //@ assert another_large_number == 30001;
    //@ assert yaln + 1 == -0x7fff;

    return 0;
}
```

In this verified C code:
- We've defined a predicate `day` to ensure values for `enum day` variables fall within the appropriate range (i.e., between 0 and 6, which represent the days of the week).
- The `next_day` function now requires and ensures the `day` predicate holds for both the input and result.
- We've avoided assigning an undefined value directly to `enum day`, maintaining the integrity of its verification by only using its enumerated values.
- We used assertions (`//@ assert`) for enum comparisons related to `large_numbers` to maintain clarity within the specified values.
