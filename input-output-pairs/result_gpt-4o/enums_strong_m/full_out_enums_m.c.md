To ensure that the C code below is verified correctly using VeriFast, we need to add appropriate specifications and ensure that the logic within the function meets these specifications. Here is the modified code with the complete specification for verification:

```c
enum day { monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday, saturday, sunday };

enum large_numbers { large_number = 30000, another_large_number, yaln = -0x7fff - 1};

enum day next_day(enum day d)
//@ requires 0 <= d && d < 7;
//@ ensures d == sunday ? result == monday : result == d + 1;
{
  if (d == sunday) {
    return monday;
  } else {
    return d + 1;
  }
}

int main() //@ : main
//@ requires true;
//@ ensures true;
{
  enum day d = monday;
  // Remove or change the following line, as it assigns an invalid value to an enum variable.
  // d = 35; // Invalid assignment to an enum type.
  assert(large_number == 30000);
  assert(another_large_number == 30001);
  assert(yaln + 1 == -0x7fff);
  return 0;
}
```

### Key Changes:

1. **Specification for `next_day`:** 
   - Updated the `ensures` clause to properly reflect the logic of wrapping around from `sunday` to `monday`. This ensures the function returns `monday` if the input is `sunday`, otherwise, it returns `d + 1`.

2. **Logic Correction in `next_day`:**
   - Added a correct handling mechanism for `sunday`, returning `monday`.

3. **Removed Invalid Assignment:**
   - The statement `d = 35;` is invalid because `35` is not a valid value for `enum day`. This line must be removed to ensure the program respects enum constraints.

These changes ensure the program logic aligns with the formal specification required for verification with VeriFast.
