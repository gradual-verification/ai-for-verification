To ensure formal verification using VeriFast, we need to define a predicate that models the state of an `account`. Here is how the C code can be modified to include detailed formal specifications using this predicate:

```c
#include "stdlib.h"

// Define a predicate that models the account's balance state
//@ predicate account_balance(struct account *acc, int balance) = malloc_block_account(acc) &*& acc->balance |-> balance;

struct account {
    int balance;
};

struct account *create_account()
//@ requires true;
//@ ensures account_balance(result, 0);
{
    struct account *myAccount = malloc(sizeof(struct account));
    if (myAccount == 0) {
        abort();
    }
    myAccount->balance = 0;
    return myAccount;
}

void account_deposit(struct account *myAccount, int amount)
/*@ requires account_balance(myAccount, ?theBalance) 
           &*& 0 <= amount 
           &*& theBalance + amount <= INT_MAX 
           &*& theBalance + amount >= INT_MIN; @*/
//@ ensures account_balance(myAccount, theBalance + amount);
{
    myAccount->balance += amount;
}

int account_get_balance(struct account *myAccount)
//@ requires account_balance(myAccount, ?balance);
//@ ensures account_balance(myAccount, balance) &*& result == balance;
{
    int result = myAccount->balance;
    return result;
}

void account_set_balance(struct account *myAccount, int newBalance)
//@ requires account_balance(myAccount, _);
//@ ensures account_balance(myAccount, newBalance);
{
    myAccount->balance = newBalance;
}

void account_dispose(struct account *myAccount)
//@ requires account_balance(myAccount, _);
//@ ensures true;
{
    free(myAccount);
}

int main()
//@ requires true;
//@ ensures true;
{
    struct account *myAccount = create_account();
    account_set_balance(myAccount, 5);
    account_deposit(myAccount, 10);
    int b = account_get_balance(myAccount);
    //@ assert(b == 15);
    account_dispose(myAccount);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Predicate Definition**: 
   - `account_balance` is defined to model the ownership and balance of an account. It includes the `malloc_block_account` predicate, which proves that the memory was allocated, and `acc->balance |-> balance` to show the link between the pointer and the balance value.

2. **Verification Conditions**:
   - Each function now has preconditions (`requires`) and postconditions (`ensures`) using the `account_balance` predicate to ensure the correctness of operations on the `account` structure.
   - The precondition of `account_deposit` checks that the added amount won't cause an overflow.
  
3. **Main Function**:
   - The `main` function asserts that after depositing the money, the balance is `15`.
  
This ensures all operations respect the formal model, maintaining memory safety, and logical correctness of the `account` balance operations.
