To add formal specifications using VeriFast to verify this C code, we need to include predicates and logic for memory and pointer management. I'll assume a simple memory model and verification checks for stack creation, pushing a node onto the stack, and disposing of the stack. Here's the complete code with the VeriFast annotations:

```c
#include "stdlib.h"

// Predicates for VeriFast
/*@
predicate node(struct node *n; struct node *next, int value) =
    n->next |-> next &*& n->value |-> value;

predicate stack(struct stack *s; struct node *head) =
    s->head |-> head;

predicate nodes(struct node *head) =
    head == 0 ? true : node(head, ?next, ?value) &*& nodes(next);
@*/

struct node
{
    struct node *next;
    int value;
};

struct stack
{
    struct node *head;
};

/***
 * Description:
 * The create_stack function creates a stack.
 *
 * @param none
 *
 * This function creates a new stack by allocating memory for
 * the struct stack. The parameter is void as it doesn't take
 * any input. It initializes the head of the stack to NULL.
 */
/*@
requires true;
ensures stack(result, 0);
@*/
struct stack *create_stack()
{
    struct stack *stack = malloc(sizeof(struct stack));
    if (stack == 0)
    {
        abort();
    }
    stack->head = 0;
    return stack;
}

/***
 * Description:
 * The stack_push function pushes a new integer value onto the stack.
 *
 * @param stack - A pointer to a stack
 * @param value - The integer value to be added on top on the stack
 *
 * It takes a struct stack pointer and an integer value as parameters.
 * It creates a new node to hold the value and links it to the current
 * head of the stack. Then, it updates the head of the stack to
 * point to the newly added node. The function ensures that the new value
 * is successfully added to the stack.
 */
/*@
requires stack(stack, ?head) &*& nodes(head);
ensures stack(stack, ?newHead) &*& nodes(newHead);
@*/
void stack_push(struct stack *stack, int value)
{
    struct node *n = malloc(sizeof(struct node));
    if (n == 0)
    {
        abort();
    }
    n->next = stack->head;
    n->value = value;
    stack->head = n;
}

/***
 * Description:
 * The stack_dispose function deletes an empty stack.
 *
 * @param stack - A pointer to a stack whose values are empty
 *
 * The function disposes of the stack by freeing the memory
 * allocated for the struct stack. It takes a struct stack
 * pointer as a parameter. The purpose of this function is to
 * deallocate the memory used by the stack once it is no longer
 * needed.
 */
/*@
requires stack(stack, 0);
ensures emp;
@*/
void stack_dispose(struct stack *stack)
{
    free(stack);
}

int main()
{
    return 0;
}
```

In this code, the `predicate` declarations define the shape of the structures VeriFast will reason about. The annotations before each function specify pre- and post-conditions using these predicates.

- `requires` clauses define what must be true before the function is called.
- `ensures` clauses describe what will be true after the function completes.

The predicates used correspond to the common stack and linked list operations, ensuring that the constraints on memory and node handling are correctly specified. The code assumes provisional handling for empty stacks in `stack_dispose`; you would need to extend this to handle lists with nodes if this were required.
