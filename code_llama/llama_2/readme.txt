 this is the code for running the code llama2

1. to run this: 

firstly create the python virtual environment: python -m venv ai

then activate: 
.\ai\Scripts\activate

then install requirements:

 pip3 install -r .\requirements.txt

then 

it has two choice, one is that just run the llama2 without changing the parameters:python .\Llama2_locally.py

another is that it could run the llama2 and then it could changing the parameters: python .\Llama2_locally_custom.py


No need to use the API key like openAI, no need to pay, because the whole llm has already been downloaded.
