The source of raw input data

For source, "solutions" means the example programs in the [VeriFast tutorial solutions](https://github.com/verifast/verifast/tree/master/tutorial_solutions), and "examples" means the example programs in the [VeriFast examples](https://github.com/verifast/verifast/tree/master/examples). A copy of solutions and examples are included in the same folder (see `tutorial_solutions/` and `examples/`).

The original version of output file of benchmarks can be found by the corresponding name at the source. For example, `account` can be found in `tutorial_solutions/account.c`, `array_of_struct` can be found in `examples/array_of_struct.c`.
