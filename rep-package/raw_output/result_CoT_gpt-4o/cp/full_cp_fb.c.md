To formally verify the C code using VeriFast, you'll need to adhere to the process of specifying preconditions, postconditions, and loop invariants to ensure the memory safety and correct integer manipulations. Let's modify the given C code to include the necessary verification specifications. Here's the complete code block with the structure and required annotations:

```c
#include "stdlib.h"
#include "stdio.h"
#include <stdbool.h>
#include "assert.h"

struct file;

// Function contracts for fopen, fread, fwrite, fclose, malloc, free are assumed to be predefined

int main(int argc, char** argv) //@ : main
//@ requires argc >= 1 &*& [_]arg_array(argv, argc);
//@ ensures true;
{
    struct file* from = 0;
    struct file* to = 0;
    char* buffer = 0;
    int nb_read = 0;

    if(argc < 3) {
        puts("Not enough parameters.");
        return -1;
    }

    from = fopen(argv[1], "r");
    to = fopen(argv[2], "w");
    buffer = malloc(100);
    
    if(buffer == 0 || from == 0 || to == 0) {
        abort();
    }

    //@ assert buffer(0, 100, _) &*& file(from, "r") &*& file(to, "w");

    nb_read = fread(buffer, 1, 100, from);

    while(0 < nb_read)
    //@ invariant buffer(0, 100, _) &*& file(from, "r") &*& file(to, "w");
    {
        int nb_written = fwrite(buffer, 1, (uintptr_t) nb_read, to);
        nb_read = fread(buffer, 1, 100, from);
    }

    fclose(from);
    fclose(to);
    free(buffer);

    //@ assert zero_length(buffer);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Precondition and Postcondition for `main`:**
   - The precondition ensures `argc` is at least 1. This assertion is based on the assumption that `argv` has at least one element for program name.
   - The line `[_]arg_array(argv, argc)` is a hypothetical predicate indicating Verifast knows `argv` is an argument array of length `argc`.
   - The postcondition simply states `true`, as we expect the program to terminate without any memory issues.

2. **Memory Safety Verification:**
   - After allocations, we assert that `buffer`, `from`, and `to` are not null before proceeding (common in C to guarantee valid pointers).
   - The annotations assume predicates like `buffer` and `file` are predefined to track heap and file resource usage.

3. **Loop Invariant:**
   - The loop invariant maintains the properties of `buffer`, `from`, and `to` that hold true before and after every iteration of the loop, ensuring safe memory access each time through the loop.

4. **Resource Management:**
   - At the end of the main function, resources such as files and allocated memory are closed and freed, respectively.

This approach captures the essential safety checks for memory operations and conditionally provides a framework for the compiler to verify these assertions in a hypothetical VeriFast environment. Depending on the actual features and libraries used in VeriFast, the exact predicates and assumptions might vary.
