Below is the modified C code that includes specifications for formal verification using VeriFast. The specifications ensure memory safety and integer bounds checking as required by the task description.

```c
#include "stdlib.h"

struct account
{
    int limit;
    int balance;
};

/*@
predicate account_pred(struct account *myAccount, int theLimit, int theBalance) =
    myAccount->limit |-> theLimit &*& myAccount->balance |-> theBalance;
@*/

struct account *create_account(int limit)
//@ requires INT_MIN <= limit &*& limit <= 0;
//@ ensures account_pred(result, limit, 0);
{
    struct account *myAccount = malloc(sizeof(struct account));
    if (myAccount == 0)
    {
        abort();
    }
    myAccount->limit = limit;
    myAccount->balance = 0;
    return myAccount;
}

int account_get_balance(struct account *myAccount)
//@ requires account_pred(myAccount, ?limit, ?balance);
//@ ensures account_pred(myAccount, limit, balance) &*& result == balance;
{
    int result = myAccount->balance;
    return result;
}

void account_deposit(struct account *myAccount, int amount)
//@ requires account_pred(myAccount, ?limit, ?balance) &*& 0 <= amount &*& balance + amount <= INT_MAX;
//@ ensures account_pred(myAccount, limit, balance + amount);
{
    myAccount->balance += amount;
}

int account_withdraw(struct account *myAccount, int amount)
//@ requires account_pred(myAccount, ?limit, ?balance) &*& 0 <= amount;
/*@ ensures account_pred(myAccount, limit, balance - result)
    &*& result == (balance - amount < limit ? balance - limit : amount); @*/
{
    int result = myAccount->balance - amount < myAccount->limit ? myAccount->balance - myAccount->limit : amount;
    myAccount->balance -= result;
    return result;
}

void account_dispose(struct account *myAccount)
//@ requires account_pred(myAccount, _, _);
//@ ensures true;
{
    free(myAccount);
}

int main()
//@ requires true;
//@ ensures true;
{
    struct account *myAccount = create_account(-100);
    account_deposit(myAccount, 200);
    int w1 = account_withdraw(myAccount, 50);
    assert(w1 == 50);
    int b1 = account_get_balance(myAccount);
    assert(b1 == 150);
    int w2 = account_withdraw(myAccount, 300);
    assert(w2 == 250);
    int b2 = account_get_balance(myAccount);
    assert(b2 == -100);
    account_dispose(myAccount);
    return 0;
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of the added specifications:

- **Precondition Adjustments:**
  - For `create_account`, we ensure the limit is non-positive (as per the comment in the original code) and within the bounds of integers.
  - For `account_deposit`, we specify that `balance + amount` must not overflow.
  
- **Postcondition Validations:**
  - The postconditions check that the appropriate properties of the data structure are maintained after operations, including the effects on the balance and ensuring memory safety.
  
- **Memory Safety and Integer Bounds:**
  - The specifications were extended to cover scenarios where an overflow might occur upon deposit and to ensure integers remain within the bounds defined by C.
  
This code amendment maintains the original logic and checks additional conditions outlined in VeriFast, leading towards complete verifiability.
