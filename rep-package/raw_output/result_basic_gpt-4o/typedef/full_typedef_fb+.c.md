To include formal verification using VeriFast for the given C code, we need to provide appropriate specifications and proof annotations that can be recognized by VeriFast. Given the simple logic, we mainly ensure that the arithmetic operations and assertions are correct. Here's how the annotated and verified C code would look:

```c
typedef int my_int;

int main()
//@ requires true;
//@ ensures true;
{
    my_int x = 5;
    int y = x;
    my_int z = 3;
    my_int t = x + z;
    //@ assert t == x + z;  // The sum is indeed x + z
    //@ assert t == 5 + 3;  // Substitute known values
    //@ assert t == 8;      // Simplifies to 8
    assert(t == 8);
    return 0;
}
``` 

In this verified version, we've added assertions within comments using VeriFast's annotation style (`//@`). These logical assertions verify the computations step-by-step to ensure the resulting value is correct according to our expectations as part of formal verification. In this case, we've confirmed that the sum `t` calculated from `x + z` is indeed the expected value, simplifying it down to confirm `t == 8`.
