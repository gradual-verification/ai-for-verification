To add formal verification using VeriFast to this C code, we need to include specifications that describe and verify the memory and permissions management for the operations on the `struct account`. Here's the modified code with VeriFast specifications:

```c
#include "stdlib.h"
//@ #include <list.gh>

struct account
{
    int balance;
};

/*@
predicate account(struct account *acc;) =
    acc->balance |-> ?b;
@*/

/***
 * Description:
The create_account function creates a new account by dynamically allocating
memory for a struct account object.

@param none

The function initializes the balance of the account to zero. If the memory allocation
fails, the function aborts. It finally returns a pointer to the newly created account.
*/
//@ requires true;
//@ ensures account(result) &*& result != 0;
struct account *create_account()
{
    struct account *myAccount = malloc(sizeof(struct account));
    if (myAccount == 0)
    {
        abort();
    }
    //@ close account(myAccount);
    myAccount->balance = 0;
    return myAccount;
}

/***
 * Description:
The account_set_balance function updates the balance of the given account
to the specified new balance.

@param myAccount - the account to be updated.
@param newBalance - the new balance to be set.

The function modifies the balance of the passed account to the
new balance value provided.
*/
//@ requires account(myAccount);
//@ ensures account(myAccount);
void account_set_balance(struct account *myAccount, int newBalance)
{
    myAccount->balance = newBalance;
}

/***
 * Description:
The account_dispose function frees the memory allocated for the given account.

@param myAccount - the account to be deleted.

The function frees the memory allocated for the existing account.
*/
//@ requires account(myAccount);
//@ ensures true;
void account_dispose(struct account *myAccount)
{
    //@ open account(myAccount);
    free(myAccount);
}

/***
 * Description:
The main function first creates an account, then set its balance and finally dispose that account.
*/
//@ requires true;
//@ ensures true;
int main()
{
    struct account *myAccount = create_account();
    account_set_balance(myAccount, 5);
    account_dispose(myAccount);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Predicates**: 
   - We introduce an `account` predicate to describe the memory layout and permissions for the `balance` field in the `struct account`.

2. **Function Contracts**:
   - Each function is annotated with `@ requires` and `@ ensures` to specify preconditions and postconditions.
   - `create_account` ensures that the returned pointer is non-null and owns the `account` resource.
   - `account_set_balance` requires and ensures the ownership of the `account` resource.
   - `account_dispose` requires the `account` resource and frees it.

3. **Resource Management**:
   - The `account` predicate uses `.balance |-> ?b` to denote ownership of the memory associated with the balance field, allowing the verifier to track resource usage. This ensures memory safety and proper deallocation.
  
By adding these specifications and predicates, the code is now properly prepared for formal verification using VeriFast, ensuring that the functions adhere to their specifications.
