To properly verify the C code with VeriFast, we need to include a datatype definition for the predicate `account_balance` and ensure all preconditions and postconditions match with what the functions are doing. Here's how the code block with the specifications would look:

```c
#include "stdlib.h"

//@ predicate account_balance(struct account *acc, int balance) = acc != 0 &*& acc->balance |-> balance;

struct account
{
    int balance;
};

struct account *create_account()
//@ requires true;
//@ ensures account_balance(result, 0);
{
    struct account *myAccount = malloc(sizeof(struct account));
    if (myAccount == 0)
    {
        abort();
    }
    myAccount->balance = 0;
    //@ close account_balance(myAccount, 0);
    return myAccount;
}

void account_set_balance(struct account *myAccount, int newBalance)
//@ requires account_balance(myAccount, _);
//@ ensures account_balance(myAccount, newBalance);
{
    //@ open account_balance(myAccount, _);
    myAccount->balance = newBalance;
    //@ close account_balance(myAccount, newBalance);
}

void account_dispose(struct account *myAccount)
//@ requires account_balance(myAccount, _);
//@ ensures true;
{
    //@ open account_balance(myAccount, _);
    free(myAccount);
}

int main()
//@ requires true;
//@ ensures true;
{
    struct account *myAccount = create_account();
    account_set_balance(myAccount, 5);
    account_dispose(myAccount);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Predicate Definition:** We define the `account_balance` predicate to describe the state of an account's balance. It ensures that the pointer `acc` is not null and that it points to the integer `balance` which the account holds.

2. **Usage of Predicate:**
   - In `create_account`, after initializing the balance to 0, we `close` the predicate `account_balance` for `myAccount`, indicating that it now holds the balance.
   - In `account_set_balance`, we `open` the existing predicate (showing we start with some balance) before setting a new balance, and then `close` it to establish the new balance.
   - In `account_dispose`, we `open` the predicate to prove that we're operating on a valid account object before freeing it.

3. **Malloc Check:** Ensures the account isn't null after allocation.

By using predicates and correctly managing them with `open` and `close`, we can formally verify that the functions are functioning as intended in terms of memory and state manipulation.
