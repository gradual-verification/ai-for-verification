Certainly! Below is the C code modified to include formal verification using VeriFast, ensuring that the specified properties are upheld correctly by the program.

```c
#include "stdlib.h"

// Define predicate for the counter structure
//@ predicate counter_f(struct counter *ctr, int v) = ctr->f |-> v;

static int x;
static struct counter *c;

struct counter {
    int f;
};

void m()
//@ requires x |-> 7 &*& c |-> ?ctr &*& counter_f(ctr, ?v) &*& v >= INT_MIN &*& v + 1 <= INT_MAX;
//@ ensures x |-> 8 &*& c |-> ctr &*& counter_f(ctr, v + 1);
{
    int y = x;
    x = y + 1;
    c->f = c->f + 1;
}

int main() //@ : main_full(globals_m)
//@ requires module(globals_m, true);
//@ ensures true;
{
    x = 7;
    struct counter *ctr = malloc(sizeof(struct counter));
    if (ctr == 0) abort();
    ctr->f = 42;
    //@ close counter_f(ctr, 42);
    c = ctr;
    m();
    int ctr_f = ctr->f;
    assert(ctr_f == 43);
    //@ open counter_f(ctr, 43);
    free(ctr);
    return 0;
}
```

### Key Changes Explained:
1. **Predicate Definition:**  
   - A predicate `counter_f` is defined to logically describe the ownership of the field `f` in the `struct counter`.
   
2. **Preconditions and Postconditions in `m`:**  
   - Specified using the predicate `counter_f` to ensure that the function `m` correctly handles the state transformation of the `counter` structure and the global variable `x`.

3. **Use of `close` and `open`:**  
   - `close counter_f(ctr, 42);` is used to establish the verifiable state of the structure after initialization.
   - `open counter_f(ctr, 43);` is used before freeing the dynamically allocated memory to ensure ownership is properly transferred back.

These changes ensure that the functional correctness and the desired properties are verified and upheld through the use of VeriFast, particularly focusing on memory management and integer bounds.
