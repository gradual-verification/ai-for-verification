To verify the C code using VeriFast, we need to add specifications in the form of annotations to describe the preconditions, postconditions, and any necessary invariants. These annotations will help VeriFast understand the memory model and prove that the code executes correctly without errors such as null pointer dereferences, double frees, etc. Here is the modified code with VeriFast annotations:

```c
#include "stdlib.h"

// Forward declaration of predicates
//@ predicate person(struct person *p, char *name, struct person *spouse);

struct person {
  char* name;
  struct person* spouse;
};

/*@
predicate person(struct person *p, char *name, struct person *spouse) =
  p != 0 &*&
  p->name |-> name &*&
  p->spouse |-> spouse;
@*/

/***
 * Description:
The `create_person` function allocates and initializes a new `person` struct with no spouse.

@param i - None.
@return - A pointer to the newly created `person` struct.
*/
/*@
requires true;
ensures person(result, ?name, 0);
@*/
struct person *create_person()
{
  struct person *p = malloc(sizeof(struct person));
  if(p == 0) abort();
  p->spouse = 0;
  //@ close person(p, 0, 0);
  return p;
}

/***
 * Description:
The `marry` function marries two unmarried `person` instances by setting their spouse pointers to each other.

@param `this` - Pointer to the first `person`.
@param `other` - Pointer to the second `person`.
*/
/*@
requires person(this, ?name1, 0) &*& person(other, ?name2, 0);
ensures person(this, name1, other) &*& person(other, name2, this);
@*/
void marry(struct person *this, struct person *other)
{
  this->spouse = other;
  other->spouse = this;
}

/***
 * Description:
The `person_get_spouse` function retrieves the spouse of the given `person`.

@param `this` - Pointer to the `person` whose spouse is to be retrieved.
@returns - A pointer to the spouse, or `0` if unmarried.
*/
/*@
requires person(this, ?name, ?spouse);
ensures person(this, name, spouse) &*& result == spouse;
@*/
struct person* person_get_spouse(struct person* this)
{
  return this->spouse;
}

/***
 * Description:
The `divorce` function divorces two married `person` instances by setting their spouse pointers to `0`.

@param `this` - Pointer to one `person` in the marriage.
*/
/*@
requires person(this, ?name1, ?spouse) &*& spouse != 0 &*& person(spouse, ?name2, this);
ensures person(this, name1, 0) &*& person(spouse, name2, 0);
@*/
void divorce(struct person* this)
{
  this->spouse->spouse = 0;
  this->spouse = 0;
}

/***
 * Description:
The `die` function handles the death of a `person` by freeing the memory and setting the spouse's spouse pointer to `0` if married.

@param `this` - Pointer to the `person` who dies.

It requires that the `person` instance and their spouse (if any) are valid.
It ensures that if the `person` had a spouse, the spouse's spouse pointer is set to `0`. The `person` instance is freed.
*/
/*@
requires person(this, ?name, ?spouse) &*& (spouse == 0 || person(spouse, ?name2, this));
ensures spouse == 0 ? true : person(spouse, name2, 0);
@*/
void die(struct person *this)
{
  if(this->spouse != 0) {
    this->spouse->spouse = 0;
  }
  free(this); 
  //@ leak person(this, _, _);
}

/***
 * Description:
The `main` function demonstrates creating `person` instances, marrying, divorcing, and handling deaths. 
Includes basic operations to test the functionality of the `person` struct and its associated functions.
*/
/*@
requires true;
ensures true;
@*/
int main() //@ : main
{
  struct person* alice = create_person();
  struct person* bob = create_person();
  struct person* eve = 0;
  marry(alice, bob);
  eve = create_person();
  divorce(bob);
  marry(bob, eve);
  die(alice);
  die(bob);
  die(eve);
  return 0;
}
```

In this code:
- We've defined a predicate `person` to describe the valid state of a `person` instance.
- Each function is annotated with `requires` and `ensures` clauses to specify the preconditions and postconditions.
- We've used the `close` and `leak` keywords for managing predicate states.
- The annotations help VeriFast verify the correctness of operations like `malloc`, pointer dereference, and `free`.
