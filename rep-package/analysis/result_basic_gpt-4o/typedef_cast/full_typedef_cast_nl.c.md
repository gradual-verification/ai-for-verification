To formally verify the given C code using VeriFast, annotations must be added to specify preconditions, postconditions, and other necessary invariants. Below is the modified code with VeriFast annotations included:

```c
#include <stdint.h>

typedef short my_short;

/*@
    requires true;
    ensures \true;
@*/
void foo(int16_t x, my_short y)
    //@ requires INT16_MIN <= x <= INT16_MAX &*& SHRT_MIN <= y <= SHRT_MAX;
    //@ ensures true;
{
    my_short z = (my_short)(x - y);
    //@ assert SHRT_MIN <= z <= SHRT_MAX;
    
    z = (int16_t)(x - y);
    //@ assert SHRT_MIN <= z <= SHRT_MAX;

    my_short *pz = &z;
    void *pv = pz;
    pz = (my_short *)pv;
}

int main()
    //@ requires true;
    //@ ensures true;
{
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Preconditions and Postconditions**: The `requires` and `ensures` annotations ensure that the function can handle any values within the range of `int16_t` and `my_short` without undefined behavior.

- **Assumptions (`assert`)**: The `assert` statements guarantee that after casting, the values are still within the expected range of a `my_short`. This assists in verifying no overflow occurs within the cast.

- **Conditions for Pointer Usage**: The VeriFast tool also checks that pointers like `pz` and types like `void *` are safely and correctly converted, although VeriFast's treatment of such low-level operations might require more context in larger programs.
