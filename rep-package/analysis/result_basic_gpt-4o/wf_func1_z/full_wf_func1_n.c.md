### Explanation

- **Precondition** (`requires n >= 0;`): The function requires that `n` is a non-negative integer. This is consistent with the functionâ€™s description.
- **Postcondition** (`ensures result == (n * (n - 1)) / 2;`): This formula is derived from the arithmetic sum formula for a range from 0 to n-1. 

- **Loop Invariant**:
  - The first part (`0 <= count <= n;`) ensures that `count` is within a valid range throughout the loop.
  - The second part (`sum == (count * (count-1)) / 2;`) maintains that the sum calculated so far matches the arithmetic series sum formula, validating the incremental steps in the loop. 
  - `decreases n - count;` specifies that the distance to loop termination decreases with each iteration, ensuring the loop eventually terminates.

By including these annotations, the code can be formally verified using tools like VeriFast, which check that the code adheres to these specified behaviors.
