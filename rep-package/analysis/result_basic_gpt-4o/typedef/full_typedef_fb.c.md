Here is the C code including the formal code verification in Verifast:

```c
#include <assert.h>

typedef int my_int;

int main()
//@ requires true;
//@ ensures true;
{
    my_int x = 5;
    int y = x;
    my_int z = 3;
    my_int t = x + z;
    //@ assert t == 8;
    assert(t == 8);
    return 0;
}
```

In this code block, the necessary includes and Verifast annotations are integrated along with the verification assertion to ensure that the value of `t` is indeed `8`.
