To include formal verification with VeriFast in the given C code, you need to add precise preconditions and postconditions, and maintain invariants where necessary. Here's how you can modify the code and specifications for VeriFast verification:

```c
#include <assert.h>

// Define typedef as per original code
typedef int my_int;

/*@ 
  // Specification for main function
  requires true;  // No preconditions
  ensures result == 0;  // The function must return 0
@*/
int main()
{   
    my_int x = 5;
    int y = x;
    my_int z = 3;
    my_int t = x + z;

    // Perform an assertion to check if the arithmetic operation is correct
    assert(t == 8); // VeriFast will attempt to verify this assertion
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Includes and Typedefs:** Make sure to include any required headers (e.g., for assert) and maintain typedefs as needed.

2. **Specifications:**
    - `requires true;` indicates no specific preconditions for the function.
    - `ensures result == 0;` specifies that the function should return `0`.

3. **Assertions:**  
    - You already have an assertion in place, which ensures that `t` indeed equals 8. VeriFast will verify this assertion, ensuring that the logic leading up to it holds true as part of the verification process.

By following this pattern, you can ensure that VeriFast will be able to verify the correctness of your implementation according to the specified logic.
