To include formal verification in Verifast, we need to add specifications (preconditions, postconditions, and any necessary invariants) using Verifast's annotations. Here's how the given C code can be modified to include these specifications:

```c
#include "stdlib.h"
#include "stdbool.h"

struct account
{
    int balance;
};

// Predicate for account
predicate account(struct account *acc; int balance) =
    acc != 0 &*& acc->balance |-> balance;

/*@
  ensures result != 0;
  ensures account(result, 0);
  @*/
struct account *create_account()
    //@ requires true;
    //@ ensures account(result, 0);
{
    struct account *myAccount = malloc(sizeof(struct account));
    if (myAccount == 0)
    {
        abort();
    }
    myAccount->balance = 0;
    return myAccount;
}

/*@
  requires account(myAccount, ?oldBalance);
  ensures account(myAccount, oldBalance + amount);
  @*/
void account_deposit(struct account *myAccount, int amount)
    //@ requires account(myAccount, ?oldBalance);
    //@ ensures account(myAccount, oldBalance + amount);
{
    myAccount->balance += amount;
}

/*@
  requires account(myAccount, ?balance);
  ensures account(myAccount, balance) &*& result == balance;
  @*/
int account_get_balance(struct account *myAccount)
    //@ requires account(myAccount, ?balance);
    //@ ensures account(myAccount, balance) &*& result == balance;
{
    int result = myAccount->balance;
    return result;
}

/*@
  requires account(myAccount, _);
  ensures account(myAccount, newBalance);
  @*/
void account_set_balance(struct account *myAccount, int newBalance)
    //@ requires account(myAccount, _);
    //@ ensures account(myAccount, newBalance);
{
    myAccount->balance = newBalance;
}

/*@
  requires account(myAccount, _);
  ensures true;
  @*/
void account_dispose(struct account *myAccount)
    //@ requires account(myAccount, _);
    //@ ensures true;
{
    free(myAccount);
}

int main()
    //@ requires true;
    //@ ensures true;
{
    struct account *myAccount = create_account();
    account_set_balance(myAccount, 5);
    account_deposit(myAccount, 10);
    int b = account_get_balance(myAccount);
    assert(b == 15);
    account_dispose(myAccount);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Predicate Definition**: We define a predicate `account(struct account *acc; int balance)` to encapsulate the state and ownership of an account's balance.

- **Function Contracts**: Each function now has Verifast annotations defining:
  - **Preconditions (`requires`)**: What must be true before the function is called. Typically involves asking for ownership of the predicate.
  - **Postconditions (`ensures`)**: What is guaranteed to be true after the function returns. Usually involves returning the predicate after modifying it appropriately.
  
- **Verification of Memory Safety and Correctness**: Verifast will now be able to verify that:
  - The memory accesses are safe.
  - Ownership of resources (the account balance) is correctly managed.
  - The account behaves according to our specifications, particularly after operations like balance updates and deposits.
