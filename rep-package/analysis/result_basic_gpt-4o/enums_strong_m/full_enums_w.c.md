To add formal code verification in VeriFast for the C code snippet provided, we must ensure that the code satisfies the preconditions and postconditions. Here is the modified code with correct formal verification annotations:

```c
enum day { monday = 0, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday, saturday, sunday };

enum large_numbers { large_number = 30000, another_large_number, yaln = -0x7fff - 1 };

// Function to get the next day of the week
enum day next_day(enum day d)
//@ requires d >= monday && d <= sunday;
//@ ensures result >= monday && result <= sunday;
//@ ensures result == ((d == sunday) ? monday : d + 1);
{
  return (d + 1) % 7;
}

int main() //@ : main
//@ requires true;
//@ ensures true;
{
  enum day d = monday;
  //@ assert d >= monday && d <= sunday;  // Ensure value of d is within the range
  int x = next_day(d);                   // Get the next day
  assert(x >= monday && x <= sunday);    // Verify the result is within enum day range
  d = 35;                                // Violation example - this goes out of bounds of enum
  //@ assert d == 35;                     // The code doesn't check validity of enum here
  assert(large_number == 30000);
  assert(another_large_number == 30001);
  assert(yaln + 1 == -0x7fff);
  return 0;
}
```

### Notes:
- The `next_day` function now verifies that the input day is in the correct range and returns a valid `enum day` value.
- Comments within the code indicate where verification annotations have been added for clarity.
- The assignment `d = 35;` introduces a potential issue since 35 is out of bounds for `enum day`. VeriFast doesn't strictly prevent out-of-bound assignments in enums, enforcing that relies on the logic and design policy of the programmer.
- VeriFast doesn't inherently prevent adding an integer to `enum`, so care should be taken to ensure values are within range as per logical assertions.

This verification ensures correctness for valid paths but does not handle cases where enums are used incorrectly with invalid integer assignments unless explicitly checked.
