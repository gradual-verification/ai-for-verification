Certainly! Here is the modified C code with Verifast specifications added for formal verification:

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "vcc.h"

/*@
predicate buffer(char *buf, int length;) =
    chars(buf, length, ?cs) &*& length >= 0;
@*/

/*@
requires buffer(buf, length);
requires length >= 0;
assigns buf[0..length-1];
ensures buffer(buf, length) &*& chars(buf, length, ?cs) &*& all_eq(cs, c);
@*/
void fill(char *buf, int length, char c)
    //@ requires buffer(buf, length);
    //@ ensures buffer(buf, length);
{
    //@ closechars(buf, length, _);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < length; i++)
        //@ invariant chars(buf, length, ?cs1) &*& 0 <= i <= length;
    {
        buf[i] = c;
    }
    
    //@ openchars(buf, length, _);
}

int main()
    //@ requires true;
    //@ ensures true;
{
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Predicates and Function Contracts**: 
  - We define the `buffer` predicate to describe the pre- and post-conditions of the operations on the `buf`.
  - The `fill` function is equipped with `requires`, `assigns`, and `ensures` clauses for specifying that it requires a valid `buffer`, modifies specified indices, and ensures `buf` remains a buffer filled with the specified character `c`.

- **Loop Invariant**: 
  - The loop encounters a modification of the `buf` contents, and the invariant ensures that the buffer remains a valid pointer with a definite state across the specified range during each iteration.

The verification involves ensuring proper memory conditions and character constraints across iterations, keeping the range in certain boundaries, preserving assumptions on preconditions, and meeting post-conditions and variable/environment states at function exit.
