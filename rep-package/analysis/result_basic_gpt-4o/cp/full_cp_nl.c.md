To verify the given C code using VeriFast, we need to add formal specifications that detail the pre-conditions, post-conditions, and intermediate assertions explicitly describing the program's behavior. Here's a code block with the complete specification and code needed to verify it with VeriFast:

```c
#include "stdlib.h"
#include "stdio.h"
#include "stdbool.h"
#include "assert.h"

/*@
  requires argc == 3;
  requires [_]is_cstring(argv[1]);
  requires [_]is_cstring(argv[2]);
  ensures result == 0 || result == -1;
  ensures (result == 0) ==> (file_exists(argv[1]) && file_exists(argv[2]));
  ensures (result == -1) ==> (!file_exists(argv[1]) || !file_exists(argv[2]));
@*/

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    struct file* from = 0; 
    struct file* to = 0; 
    char* buffer = 0; 
    int nb_read = 0;

    if(argc < 3) { puts("Not enough parameters."); return -1; }

    from = fopen(argv[1], "r");
    to = fopen(argv[2], "w");
    buffer = malloc(100);

    if(buffer == 0 || from == 0 || to == 0) { abort(); }

    /*@ loop_invariant buffer != 0 &*& from != 0 &*& to != 0; @*/
    while(0 < (nb_read = fread(buffer, 1, 100, from)))
    {
        int nb_written = fwrite(buffer, 1, (uintptr_t)nb_read, to);
        //@ assert nb_written == nb_read;
    }

    fclose(from);
    fclose(to);
    free(buffer);

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Pre-conditions** (`requires`): Specify that the program requires exactly 3 command-line arguments, which are strings representing filenames. We use `is_cstring` to indicate that the `argv` array contains valid strings.
  
- **Post-conditions** (`ensures`): Specify the expected outcomes from the `main` function. If the return value `result` is `0`, both files (input and output) should exist. If the return value is `-1`, it implies a failure to open either of the files.

- **Loop Invariant** (`loop_invariant`): Assert certain conditions that should hold true before and after each iteration of the loop, ensuring the correct behavior of the program within the loop.

- **Assertions**: An assertion inside the loop checks whether the amount of data read (`nb_read`) is exactly the same as the amount written (`nb_written`). This ensures that data is correctly transferred between files.

By adding these annotations, the program's behavior is specified clearly, which VeriFast can then use to perform formal verification of the code.
