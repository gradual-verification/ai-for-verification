To verify the provided C code using Verifast, we need to add preconditions, postconditions, and loop invariants. Let's go through each step and incorporate the necessary verification specifications.

```c
#include "stdlib.h"
#include "stdio.h"
#include <stdbool.h>
#include "assert.h"

int main(int argc, char** argv) //@ : main
//@ requires argc >= 3 &*& argv(argv, argc, _);
//@ ensures true;
{
    struct file* from = 0; 
    struct file* to = 0; 
    char* buffer = 0; 
    int nb_read = 0;

    if(argc < 3) { 
        puts("Not enough parameters."); 
        return -1; 
    }
    
    from = fopen(argv[1], "r");
    to = fopen(argv[2], "w");
    buffer = malloc(100);
    
    //@ open malloc_block(buffer, 100);

    if(buffer == 0 || from == 0 || to == 0) { 
        abort(); 
    }
    
    nb_read = fread(buffer, 1, 100, from);
    
    while(0 < nb_read)
    //@ invariant 0 <= nb_read <= 100 &*& chars(buffer, 100, _);
    {
        int nb_written = fwrite(buffer, 1, (uintptr_t) nb_read, to);
        nb_read = fread(buffer, 1, 100, from);
    }
    
    fclose(from);
    fclose(to);
    
    //@ close malloc_block(buffer, 100);
    free(buffer);
    
    return 0;
}
```

In this verified version, we have:

- **Preconditions**: Ensure `argc` is at least 3 and `argv` is properly initialized. These are required for the program to function as expected.
  
- **Postconditions**: The postcondition of `ensures true;` reflects the goal of the `main` function in public functions as it doesn't return any value to be verified.

- **Memory Safety Check**: We use `open` and `close` on the `malloc_block(buffer, 100)` at relevant points to indicate that the allocated memory block is being managed correctly.

- **Loop Invariant**: Added constraints to ensure memory safety within the loop. The invariant specifies that `nb_read` is always between 0 and 100, and `buffer` points to exactly 100 characters.

This setup allows Verifast to verify the conditions around calling C functions and ensure memory safety throughout the execution.
