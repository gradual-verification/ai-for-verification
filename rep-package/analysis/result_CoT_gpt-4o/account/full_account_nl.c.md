Here is the modified C code with Verifast specifications:

```c
#include "stdlib.h"

struct account
{
    int balance;
};

/*@
predicate account(struct account *myAccount; int balance) =
    myAccount->balance |-> balance;
@*/

/*@
requires true;
ensures result != 0 &*& account(result, 0);
@*/
struct account *create_account()
{
    struct account *myAccount = malloc(sizeof(struct account));
    if (myAccount == 0)
    {
        abort();
    }
    //@ close account(myAccount, 0);
    myAccount->balance = 0;
    return myAccount;
}

/*@
requires account(myAccount, _);
ensures account(myAccount, newBalance);
@*/
void account_set_balance(struct account *myAccount, int newBalance)
{
    //@ open account(myAccount, _);
    myAccount->balance = newBalance;
    //@ close account(myAccount, newBalance);
}

/*@
requires account(myAccount, _);
ensures true;
@*/
void account_dispose(struct account *myAccount)
{
    //@ open account(myAccount, _);
    free(myAccount);
}

/*@
requires true;
ensures true;
@*/
int main()
{
    struct account *myAccount = create_account();
    account_set_balance(myAccount, 5);
    account_dispose(myAccount);
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Predicate Definition**: A predicate `account` is defined to track the state of the `balance` field for each `account` struct instance. It asserts ownership of `myAccount->balance`.

2. **`create_account` Function**: 
   - **Precondition**: Requires nothing specifically. `requires true;`.
   - **Postcondition**: Ensures the returned pointer is not NULL and initializes an account with the balance set to 0. Ensures `account(result, 0);`.

3. **`account_set_balance` Function**: 
   - **Precondition**: Requires ownership of the memory location (`requires account(myAccount, _);`), leaving the balance unspecified (`_`).
   - **Postcondition**: Modifies the balance to `newBalance` and ensures ownership is maintained with the new balance.

4. **`account_dispose` Function**:
   - **Precondition**: Requires ownership of the account (`requires account(myAccount, _);`).
   - **Postcondition**: Frees the memory and does not need to ensure further, hence `ensures true;`.

5. **`main` Function**: 
   - **Precondition and Postcondition**: Both are set to `true` as the function manages its internal memory and state safely with correct specifications.

These specifications ensure that memory safety is maintained, and any use of the `account` structure is properly verified by ownership assertions, preventing undefined behavior due to unsafe memory access.
