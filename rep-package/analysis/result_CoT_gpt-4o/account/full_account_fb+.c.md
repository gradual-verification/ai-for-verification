To include formal code verification using VeriFast, we need to annotate the code with preconditions and postconditions, define predicates, and ensure memory safety and bounds checking. Here's the modified version of the C code with these annotations:

```c
#include "stdlib.h"

// Predicate to represent an account and its balance
//@ predicate account_balance(struct account* myAccount, int balance) = myAccount->balance |-> balance;

struct account {
    int balance;
};

struct account *create_account()
//@ requires true;
//@ ensures account_balance(result, 0) &*& malloc_block_account(result);
{
    struct account *myAccount = malloc(sizeof(struct account));
    if (myAccount == 0)
    {
        abort();
    }
    myAccount->balance = 0;
    //@ close account_balance(myAccount, 0);
    return myAccount;
}

void account_set_balance(struct account *myAccount, int newBalance)
//@ requires account_balance(myAccount, _);
//@ ensures account_balance(myAccount, newBalance);
{
    //@ open account_balance(myAccount, _);
    myAccount->balance = newBalance;
    //@ close account_balance(myAccount, newBalance);
}

void account_dispose(struct account *myAccount)
//@ requires account_balance(myAccount, _) &*& malloc_block_account(myAccount);
//@ ensures true;
{
    //@ open account_balance(myAccount, _);
    free(myAccount);
}

int main()
//@ requires true;
//@ ensures true;
{
    struct account *myAccount = create_account();
    account_set_balance(myAccount, 5);
    account_dispose(myAccount);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Predicate Definition:**
   - A predicate `account_balance` is defined to manage the balance of an account.
   - It represents the knowledge that a `struct account*` has a specific balance.

2. **Preconditions and Postconditions:**
   - Each function has been annotated with its preconditions (`requires`) and postconditions (`ensures`).
   - For `create_account`, the precondition is `true` (no constraints), and the postcondition ensures that the result has a balance of `0` and is a valid memory block (`malloc_block_account`).
   - `account_set_balance` requires the balance of an account to be known and ensures the balance is updated.
   - `account_dispose` requires the structural integrity of the account to be verified before freeing the memory.

3. **Open and Close:**
   - The `open` statement is used to unfold the predicate to perform updates on the account balance.
   - The `close` statement is used to refold the predicate after the balance is updated.

4. **Memory Safety:**
   - Uses `malloc_block_account` to ensure that the memory block is valid before calling `free`.

This annotated version represents a complete specification that verifies memory safety and correct balance handling using Verifast's formal verification approach.
