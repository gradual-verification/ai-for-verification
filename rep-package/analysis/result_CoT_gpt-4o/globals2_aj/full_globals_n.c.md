To verify the given C code using VeriFast, we need to annotate the code with proper specifications that detail the preconditions, postconditions, loop invariants, and ensure safe memory access. I'll add these annotations and comments to guide the verification process.

```c
#include "stdlib.h"
#include "verifast.h"

static int x;

struct counter {
    int f;
};

// Predicate to describe the state of a counter object
predicate counter(struct counter *c;) =
    c != 0 &*& c->f |-> ?f;

// Predicate to describe globally accessible structure 'c'
predicate global_counter() =
    counter(c);

// Predicates for global integer x
predicate global_x() =
    [1/2]integer(&x, ?gx);

static struct counter *c;

/***
 * Description:
The m function updates the value of a global variable x and also increments the value of a field f within a global structure c.
*/
/*@
requires
  global_counter() &*&
  global_x();
ensures
  global_counter() &*&
  global_x();
@*/
void m()
{
    //@ open global_counter();
    //@ open global_x();
    int y = x;
    x = y + 1;
    c->f = c->f + 1;
    //@ close global_counter();
    //@ close global_x();
}

/***
 * Description:
The main function serves as the entry point of the program and allocates memory for a global structure, 
initializes its field f, assigns this structure to a global pointer c, 
calls the m() function, and performs validation on the updated value of field f.
*/
/*@
requires
  true;
ensures
  emp;
@*/
int main()
{
    x = 7;
    struct counter *ctr = malloc(sizeof(struct counter));
    if (ctr == 0) abort();
    //@ close counter(ctr);
    ctr->f = 42;
    c = ctr;
    //@ close global_counter();
    //@ close global_x();
    m();
    //@ open global_counter();
    int ctr_f = ctr->f;
    assert(ctr_f == 43);
    //@ open counter(ctr);
    free(ctr);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Predicates**: 
   - We define `counter` and `global_counter` predicates to represent the state of the heap-allocated struct `counter` and globally accessible structure `c`. 
   - We define `global_x` for global integer `x`.

2. **Preconditions and Postconditions**: 
   - For the function `m`, we specify that it requires the global counter and global integer state, and these should be maintained after the function call.
   - The `main` function starts with no requirements (`requires true;`) and ensures that all memory is freed (`ensures emp;`).

3. **Memory Safety and Integer Bounds**:
   - We handle memory allocation and deallocation safely by explicitly opening and closing predicates.
   - We use handles for `x` and ensure operations do not cause overflow (left simple for the example).

4. **Assertions**:
   - An `assert` is used to verify that the field `f` in the counter is incremented correctly.

This setup allows VeriFast to statically verify the safety and correctness of the code by ensuring the consistency of predicates before and after function calls.
