To formally verify the given C code using VeriFast, we need to add specifications, such as preconditions and postconditions, as well as loop invariants if applicable. In this case, the code provided doesn't contain any loops or complex data structures, so our focus will be on memory safety and integer bounds. Below is the modified code with the required Verifast specifications:

```c
// Declaration of a typedef for `my_int`
typedef int my_int;

// Main function with Verifast specifications
int main()
    //@ requires true; // No specific input constraints are needed
    /*@
    ensures true; // Execution completes without violating memory safety
                 // or integer bounds (ensures all expressions evaluated correctly).
    @*/
{
    my_int x = 5; // Initializing a my_int (alias for int) to 5
    int y = x;    // Copying value of x to y
    my_int z = 3; // Initializing another my_int to 3
    my_int t = x + z; // Adding x and z and storing the result in t

    // Assertion to ensure the value of t is as expected
    assert(t == 8);

    // Return 0 indicating successful completion
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Precondition and Postcondition:**
   - The `requires true;` precondition remains unchanged since no special input requirements are necessary.
   - The postcondition `ensures true;` asserts that the program will complete execution safely, implying that all operations (like addition and assignment) are memory safe and integers remain in bounds.

2. **Integer Bound Checking:**
   - The use of plain integers in this context (e.g., values are small and within typical `int` range) is safe under most conditions and systems. Specific bounds checking isn't necessary unless dealing with edge cases not specified in your initial code.

3. **Assertions:**
   - `assert(t == 8);` This asserts that the arithmetic performed with the variables results in the expected value, confirming the logic of `t = x + z` with constant integers is correct.

Since the function `main` is simple and doesn't contain loops, there's no need for loop invariants or additional safety assertions/manual state checks beyond what is already specified by `assert()` and basic memory safety guaranteed by int types under default conditions.

These annotations ensure that the code will meet all specified safety and correctness conditions when verified with the tool VeriFast.
