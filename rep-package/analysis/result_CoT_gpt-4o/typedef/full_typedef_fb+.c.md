```c
typedef int my_int;

// Main function
int main()
//@ requires true; // No specific input requirements, main is the starting point
//@ ensures true;  // Ensures no specific outcome, just the program terminates without issues
{
    my_int x = 5;
    int y = x;
    my_int z = 3;
    my_int t = x + z;
    //@ assert t == 8; // An assertion to verify correct computation of t
    return 0;
}
```

In this simple program, the main function doesn't contain any memory allocations or complex computations that could produce substantial errors. Therefore, the preconditions and postconditions are quite straightforward, ensuring that the function starts and finishes correctly. The assertion `t == 8` serves as a correctness check for the computation within the program. In this particular example, there are no additional predicates, loops, or auxiliary specifications necessary, as the code is memory-safe and integer calculations are straightforward and within bounds.
